= Optional extensions

Each of the optional extensions in this appendix has been approved by the SYCL
working group.
These extensions may be promoted to core features in future versions of the SYCL
specification, but their design is subject to change.

(There are currently no extensions in this appendix.)

// leveloffset=2 allows extensions to be written as standalone documents
// include::sycl_khr_extension_name.adoc[leveloffset=2]
