# squash-commits.sh [--create] <branch>
#
# Script that maintains a branch of squashed commits, where each commit
# represents one PR that was merged into <branch>.  To use this script, first
# create a new branch <squashed> that will hold the squashed commit history of
# some target branch <branch>.  The squashed branch should start somewhere on
# the first parent chain of <branch>:
#
#   $ git branch <squashed> <start-point>
#
# then run:
#
#   $ squash-commits.sh --create <branch>
#
# This will create squashed commits for each PR merged into <branch> since
# <start-point>.  Thereafter, you may periodically run these commands to add
# new squashed commits for additional PRs that have been merged into <branch>:
#
#   $ git checkout <squashed>
#   $ squash-commits.sh <branch>
