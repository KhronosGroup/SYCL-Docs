# updates copyright dates in the following forms:
#
# Copyright <begin-date>-<end-date> The Khronos Group
# Copyright (c) <begin-date>-<end-date> The Khronos Group
#
# And it only updates the <end-date> if the original value is the previous year
# (i.e. last year, assuming you run the script at the beginning of the year).
#
# We intentionally do not update copyright notices from other companies.
#
# The script also performs a check for Khronos copyright notices that do not
# follow either of the patterns above.  If any such notices are found, they are
# printed to stdout.  These lines should be examined and modified manually.
