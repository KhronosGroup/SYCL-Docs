[[cha:feature-sets]]
= Feature sets

As of SYCL 2020 there are now two distinct feature sets which a SYCL
implementation can conform to, in order to better fit the requirements of
different domains, such as embedded, mobile, and safety critical, which may have
limitations because of the toolchains used.

A SYCL implementation can choose to conform to either the full feature set or
the reduced feature set.


[[sec:feature-sets.full]]
== Full feature set

The full feature set includes all features specified in the <<core-spec>> with
no exceptions.


[[sec:feature-sets.reduced]]
== Reduced feature set

The reduced feature set makes certain features optional or restricted to
specific forms.
The following list defines all the differences between the reduced feature set
and the full feature set.

  . *Un-named SYCL kernel functions:* <<sycl-kernel-function,SYCL kernel
    functions>> which are defined using a lambda expression and therefore have
    no standard name are required to be provided a name via the kernel name
    template parameter of kernel invocation functions such as
    [code]#parallel_for#.
    This overrides the <<core-spec>> rules for <<sycl-kernel-function>> naming
    as specified in <<subsec:invokingkernels>>.

  . *Address space mode:* The <<subsec:addrspaceAssignment, address space
    assignment>> mode used in the reduced feature set is not required to be
    <<subsec:genericAddressSpace, generic address space>>, regardless of SYCL
    backend in use.
    Instead the <<subsec:inferredAddressSpace, inferred address space>> mode may
    always be used.

  . *Declarations:* In addition to the requirements specified in
    <<subsec:commonAddressSpace>>, the reduced feature set does not require
    support for odr-use inside <<device-function,device functions>> of variables
    declared [code]#const# or [code]#constexpr# with static storage duration.


[[sec:feature-sets.compatibility]]
== Compatibility

In order to avoid introducing any kind of divergence the reduced and full
feature sets are defined such that the full feature set is a subsumption of the
reduced feature set.
This means that any applications which are developed for the reduced feature set
will be compatible with both a SYCL reduced implementation and a SYCL full
implementation.


[[sec:feature-sets.conformance]]
== Conformance

One of the reasons for having this be defined in the specification is that
hardware vendors which wish to support SYCL on their platform(s) want to be able
to demonstrate their support for it by passing conformance.
However, if passing conformance means adopting features which they do not
believe to be necessary at an additional development effort then this may deter
them.

Each feature set has its own route for passing conformance allowing adopters of
SYCL to specify the feature set they wish to test conformance against.
The conformance test suite would then alter or disable the tests within the test
suite according to how the feature sets are differentiated above.
