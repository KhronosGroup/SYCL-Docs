[glossary]
[[accessor]]accessor::
    An accessor is a class which allows a <<command>> to access data managed by
    a <<buffer>> or <<image>> class or allows a <<sycl-kernel-function>> to
    access local memory on a <<device>>.
    Accessors are also used to express the dependencies among the different
    <<command-group, command groups>>.
    For the full description please refer to <<subsec:accessors>>

[[application-scope]]application scope::
    The application scope starts with the construction first <<sycl-runtime>>
    class object and finishes with the destruction of the last one.
    Application refers to the {cpp} <<sycl-application>> and not the
    <<sycl-runtime>>.

[[aspect]]aspect::
    A characteristic of a <<device>> which determines whether it supports some
    optional feature.
    Aspects are always boolean, so a <<device>> either has or does not have an
    aspect.

[[async-error]]asynchronous error::
    A SYCL asynchronous error is an error occurring after the host API call
    invoking the error causing action has returned, such that the error cannot
    be thrown as a typical {cpp} exception from a host API call.
    Such errors are typically generated from device kernel invocations which are
    executed when SYCL task graph dependencies are satisfied, which occur
    asynchronously from host code execution.
    For the full description and associated asynchronous error handling
    mechanisms, please refer to <<error-handling>>.

[[async-handler]]async_handler::
    An asynchronous error handler object is a function class instance providing
    necessary code for handling all the asynchronous errors triggered from the
    execution of command groups on a queue, within a context or an associated
    event.
    For the full description please refer to <<subsec:exception.class>>.

[[barrier]]barrier::
    A barrier may refer to either a <<queue-barrier>> used for host-device
    coordination, or a <<group-barrier>> used to coordinate work-items in a
    kernel.

[[blocking-accessor]]blocking accessor::
    A blocking accessor is an <<accessor>> which provides immediate access and
    continues to provide access until it is destroyed.
    For the full description please refer to <<subsec:accessors>>

[[buffer]]buffer::
+
--
The buffer class manages data for the SYCL {cpp} host application and the SYCL
device kernels.
The buffer class may acquire ownership of some host pointers passed to its
constructors according to the constructor kind.

The buffer class, together with the accessor class, is responsible for tracking
memory transfers and guaranteeing data consistency among the different kernels.
The <<sycl-runtime>> manages the memory allocations on both the host and the
<<device>> within the lifetime of the buffer object.
For the full description please refer to <<subsec:buffers>>.
--

[[bundle-state]]bundle state::
    A SYCL bundle state represents the state of a <<kernel-bundle>> and
    therefore its capabilities in the SYCL programming API.
    Possible states are <<input>>, <<object>> or <<executable>>.

[[command]]command::
    A request to execute work that is submitted to a <<queue>> such as the
    invocation of a <<sycl-kernel-function>>, the invocation of a <<host-task>>
    or an asynchronous copy.

[[command-group]]command group::
    In SYCL, the operations required to process data on a <<device>> are
    represented using a <<command-group-function-object>>.
    Each <<command-group-function-object>> is given a unique <<handler>> object
    to perform all the necessary work required to correctly process data on a
    <<device>> using a kernel.
    In this way, the group of commands for transferring and processing data is
    enqueued as a command group on a <<device>> for execution.
    A command group is submitted atomically to a SYCL queue.

[[command-group-function-object]]command group function object::
    A type which is callable with [code]#operator()# that takes a reference to a
    <<handler>>, that defines a <<command-group>> which can be submitted by a
    <<queue>>.
    The function object can be a named type, lambda function or
    [code]#std::function#.

[[handler]]command group handler::
    The command group handler class provides the interface for the commands that
    can be executed inside the <<command-group-scope>>.
    It is provided as a scoped object to all of the data access requests within
    the command group scope.
    For the full description please refer to <<sec:handlerClass>>.

[[command-group-scope]]command group scope::
    The command group scope is the function scope defined by the
    <<command-group-function-object>>.
    The command group <<handler>> object lifetime is restricted to the command
    group scope.
    For more details see <<sec:command.group.scope>>.

[[queue-barrier]]command queue barrier::
    The [code]#sycl::queue::wait()# and [code]#sycl::queue::wait_and_throw()#
    functions block the calling thread until the execution of a
    <<command-group-function-object>> completes.

[[constant-memory]]constant memory::
    A region of memory that remains constant during the execution of a kernel.
    The <<sycl-runtime>> allocates and initializes memory objects placed into
    constant memory.

[[context]]context::
    A <<context>> represents the runtime data structures and state required by a
    <<backend>> API to interact with a group of <<device,devices>> associated
    with a <<platform>>.
    The context is defined as the [code]#sycl::context# class, for further
    details please see <<sec:interface.context.class>>.

[[control-flow]]control flow::
    When all <<work-item, work-items>> in a <<group>> are executing the same
    sequence of statements, they are said to be executing under _converged_
    control flow.
    Control flow _diverges_ when different work-items in a group execute a
    different sequence of statements, typically as a result of evaluating
    conditions differently (e.g. in selection statements or loops).

[[core-spec]]core SYCL specification::
    The text of the SYCL language specification (this document), excluding the
    text of any backend specifications and excluding the text for any
    extensions.

[[descendent-device]]descendent device::
    The descendent devices of device _D_ include all of the sub-devices of _D_,
    all of the sub-devices of those devices, etc.

[[device]]device::
    A SYCL device is an abstraction of a piece of hardware that can execute
    <<sycl-kernel-function,SYCL kernels>>.

[[device-compiler]]device compiler::
    A SYCL device compiler is a compiler that produces <<device>> binaries from
    a valid <<sycl-application>>.
    For the full description please refer to <<chapter.device.compiler>>.

[[device-copyable]]device copyable::
    Data that is shared between the host and the devices must generally have a
    type that abides by the restrictions listed in <<sec::device.copyable>> for
    a device copyable type.

[[device-function]]device function::
    A device function is any function in a <<sycl-application>> that can be run
    on a <<device>>.
    This includes <<sycl-kernel-function, SYCL kernel functions>> and,
    recursively, functions they call.

[[device-image]]device image::
    A device image is a representation of one or more <<kernel,kernels>> in an
    implementation-defined format.
    A device image could be a compiled version of the kernels in an intermediate
    language representation which needs to be translated at runtime into a form
    that can be invoked on a <<device>>, it could be a compiled version of the
    kernels in a native code format that is ready to be invoked without further
    translation, or it could be a source code representation which needs to be
    compiled before it can be invoked.
    Other representations are possible too.

[[device-selector]]device selector::
    A way to select a device used in various places.
    This is a callable object taking a <<device>> reference and returning an
    integer rank.
    One of the device with the highest non-negative value is selected.
    See <<sec:device-selector>> for more details.

[[event]]event::
    A SYCL object that represents the status of an operation that is being
    executed by the SYCL runtime.

[[executable]]executable::
    A state which a <<kernel-bundle>> can be in, representing
    <<sycl-kernel-function,SYCL kernel functions>> as an executable.

[[generic-memory]]generic memory::
    Generic memory is a virtual memory region which can represent
    <<global-memory>>, <<local-memory>> and <<private-memory>> region.

[[global-id]]global id::
    As in OpenCL, a global ID is used to uniquely identify a <<work-item>> and
    is derived from the number of global <<work-item,work-items>> specified when
    executing a kernel.
    A global ID is a one, two or three-dimensional value that starts at 0 per
    dimension.

[[global-memory]]global memory::
    Global memory is a memory region accessible to all <<work-item,work-items>>
    executing on a <<device>>.

[[group]]group::
    A group of work-items within the index space of a SYCL kernel execution,
    such as a <<work-group>> or <<sub-group>>.

[[group-barrier]]group barrier::
    A coordination mechanism for all <<work-item,work-items>> of a group.
    See the definition of the [code]#group_barrier# function.

[[h-item]]h-item::
    A unique identifier representing a single <<work-item>> within the index
    space of a SYCL kernel hierarchical execution.
    Can be one, two or three dimensional.
    In the SYCL interface a <<h-item>> is represented by the [code]#h_item#
    class (see <<hitem-class>>).

[[host]]host::
    Host is the system that executes the {cpp} application including the SYCL
    API.

[[host-pointer]]host pointer::
    A pointer to memory on the host.
    Cannot be accessed directly from a <<device>>.

[[host-task]]host task::
    A <<command>> which invokes a native {cpp} callable, scheduled conforming to
    SYCL dependency rules.

[[host-task-command]]host task command::
    A type of command that can be used inside a <<command-group>> in order to
    schedule a native {cpp} function.

[[id]]id::
    It is a unique identifier of an item in an index space.
    It can be one, two or three dimensional index space, since the SYCL kernel
    execution model is an <<nd-range>>.
    It is one of the index space classes.
    For the full description please refer to <<id-class>>.

[[image]]image::
    Images in SYCL, like buffers, are abstractions of multidimensional
    structured arrays.
    Image can refer to [code]#unsampled_image# and [code]#sampled_image#.
    For the full description please refer to <<subsec:images>>.

[[implementation-defined]]implementation-defined::
    Behavior that is explicitly allowed to vary between conforming
    implementations of SYCL.
    A SYCL implementer is required to document the implementation-defined
    behavior.

[[index-space-classes]]index space classes::
    Like in OpenCL, the kernel execution model defines an <<nd-range>> index
    space.
    The <<sycl-runtime>> class that defines an <<nd-range>> is the
    [code]#sycl::nd_range#, which takes as input the sizes of global and local
    work-items, represented using the [code]#sycl::range# class.
    The kernel library classes for indexing in the defined <<nd-range>> are the
    following classes:
+
  * [code]#sycl::id# : The basic index class representing an <<id>>;
  * [code]#sycl::item# : The <<item>> index class that contains the
    <<global-id>> and <<local-id>>;
  * [code]#sycl::nd_item# : The <<nd-item>> index class that contains the
    <<global-id>>, <<local-id>> and the <<work-group-id>>;
  * [code]#sycl::group# : The <<group>> class that contains the
    <<work-group-id>> and the member functions on a <<work-group>>.

[[input]]input::
    A state which a <<kernel-bundle>> can be in, representing
    <<sycl-kernel-function,SYCL kernel functions>> as a source or intermediate
    representation

[[item]]item::
    An item id is an interface used to retrieve the <<global-id>>,
    <<work-group-id>> and <<local-id>>.
    For further details see <<subsec:item.class>>.

[[kernel]]kernel::
    A kernel represents a <<sycl-kernel-function>> that has been compiled for a
    device, including all of the <<device-function,device functions>> it calls.
    A kernel is implicitly created when a <<sycl-kernel-function>> is submitted
    to a device via a <<kernel-invocation-command>>.
    However, a kernel can also be created manually by pre-compiling a
    <<kernel-bundle>> (see <<sec:interfaces.bundles>>).

[[kernel-bundle]]kernel bundle::
    A kernel bundle is a collection of <<device-image,device images>> that are
    associated with the same <<context>> and with a set of <<device,devices>>.
    Kernel bundles have one of three states: <<input>>, <<object>> or
    <<executable>>.
    Kernel bundles in the executable state are ready to be invoked on a device,
    whereas bundles in the other states need to be translated into the
    executable state before they can be invoked.

[[kernel-handler]]kernel handler::
    A representation of a <<sycl-kernel-function>> being invoked that is
    available to the <<kernel-scope>>.

// May conflict with host_task MR

[[kernel-invocation-command]]kernel invocation command::
    A type of command that can be used inside a <<command-group>> in order to
    schedule a <<sycl-kernel-function>>, includes [code]#single_task#, all
    variants of [code]#parallel_for# and [code]#parallel_for_workgroup#.

[[kernel-name]]kernel name::
    A kernel name is a class type that is used to assign a name to the kernel
    function, used to link the host system with the kernel object output by the
    device compiler.
    For details on naming kernels please see <<sec:naming.kernels>>.

[[kernel-scope]]kernel scope::
    The function scope of the [code]#operator()# on a <<sycl-kernel-function>>.
    Note that any function or member function called from the kernel is also
    compiled in kernel scope.
    The kernel scope allows {cpp} language extensions as well as restrictions to
    reflect the capabilities of devices.
    The extensions and restrictions are defined in the SYCL device compiler
    specification.

[[local-id]]local id::
    A unique identifier of a <<work-item>> among other work-items of a
    <<work-group>>.

[[local-memory]]local memory::
    Local memory is a memory region associated with a <<work-group>> and
    accessible only by <<work-item,work-items>> in that <<work-group>>.

[[native-backend-object]]native backend object::
    An opaque object defined by a specific backend that represents a high-level
    SYCL object on said backend.
    There is no guarantee of having native backend objects for all SYCL types.

[[native-specialization-constant]]native-specialization constant::
    A <<specialization-constant>> in a device image whose value can be used by
    an online compiler as an immediate value during the compilation.


[[nd-item]]nd-item::
    A unique identifier representing a single <<work-item>> and <<work-group>>
    within the index space of a SYCL kernel execution.
    Can be one, two or three dimensional.
    In the SYCL interface an <<nd-item>> is represented by the [code]#nd_item#
    class (see <<nditem-class>>).

[[nd-range]]nd-range::
    A representation of the index space of a SYCL kernel execution, the
    distribution of <<work-item,work-items>> within into
    <<work-group,work-groups>>.
    Contains a <<range>> specifying the number of global
    <<work-item,work-items>>, a <<range>> specifying the number of local
    <<work-item,work-items>> and a <<id>> specifying the global offset.
    Can be one, two or three dimensional.
    The minimum size of <<range>> within the <<nd-range>> is 0 per dimension;
    where any dimension is set to zero, the index space in all dimensions will
    be zero.
    In the SYCL interface an <<nd-range>> is represented by the [code]#nd_range#
    class (see <<subsubsec:nd-range-class>>).

[[mem-fence]]mem-fence::
    A memory fence provides control over re-ordering of memory load and store
    operations when coupled with an atomic operation.
    See the definition of the [code]#sycl::atomic_fence# function.

[[object]]object::
    A state which a <<kernel-bundle>> can be in, representing
    <<sycl-kernel-function,SYCL kernel functions>> as a non-executable object.

[[platform]]platform::
    A collection of <<device,devices>> managed by a single <<backend,backend>>.

[[private-memory]]private memory::
    A region of memory private to a <<work-item>>.
    Variables defined in one work-item's private memory are not visible to
    another work-item.
    The [code]#sycl::private_memory# class provides access to the work-item's
    private memory for the hierarchical API as it is described at
    <<paragraph.private.memory>>.

[[queue]]queue::
    A SYCL command queue is an object that holds command groups to be executed
    on a SYCL <<device>>.
    SYCL provides a heterogeneous platform integration using device queue, which
    is the minimum requirement for a SYCL application to run on a SYCL
    <<device>>.
    For the full description please refer to <<sec:interface.queue.class>>.

[[range]]range::
    A representation of a number of <<work-item,work-items>> or
    <<work-group,work-groups>> within the index space of a SYCL kernel
    execution.
    Can be one, two or three dimensional.
    In the SYCL interface a <<range>> is represented by the [code]#range# class
    (see <<range-class>>).

[[ranged-accessor]]ranged accessor::
    A ranged accessor is a host or buffer <<accessor>> that was constructed with
    a non-zero offset into the data buffer or with an access range smaller than
    the range of the data buffer, or both.
    Please refer to <<sec:accessors.ranged>> for more info.

[[reduction]]reduction::
    An operation that produces a single value by combining multiple values in an
    unspecified order using a binary operator.
    If the operator is non-associative or non-commutative, the behavior of a
    reduction may be non-deterministic.

[[root-device]]root device::
    A device that is not a sub-device.
    The function [code]#device::get_devices()# returns a vector of all the root
    devices.

[[rule-of-five]]rule of five::
    For a given class, if at least one of the copy constructor, move
    constructor, copy assignment operator, move assignment operator or
    destructor is explicitly declared, all of them should be explicitly
    declared.

[[rule-of-zero]]rule of zero::
    For a given class, if the copy constructor, move constructor, copy
    assignment operator, move assignment operator and destructor would all be
    inlined, public and defaulted, none of them should be explicitly declared.

[[smcp]]SMCP::
     The single-source multiple compiler-passes (SMCP)
    technique allows a single-source file to be parsed by multiple compilers for
    building native programs per compilation target.
    For example, a standard {cpp} CPU compiler for targeting <<host>> will parse
    the <<sycl-file>> to create the {cpp} <<sycl-application>> which offloads
    parts of the computation to other <<device,devices>>.
    A SYCL device compiler will parse the same source file and target only SYCL
    kernels.
    For the full description please refer to <<subsec:smcp>>.
    See <<sscp>> for another approach.

[[specialization-constant]]specialization constant::
    A constant variable where the value is not known until compilation of the
    <<sycl-kernel-function>>.

[[specialization-id]]specialization id::
    An identifier which represents a reference to a <<specialization-constant>>
    both in the <<sycl-application>> for setting the value prior to the
    compilation of a <<kernel-bundle>> and in a <<sycl-kernel-function>> for
    retrieving the value during invocation.

[[sscp]]SSCP::
    The single-source single compiler-pass (SSCP) technique allows a
    single-source file to be parsed only once by a single compiler.
    For example, the SYCL compiler will parse the <<sycl-file>> once.
    Then, from this single intermediate representation, for each kind of device
    architecture a compilation flow will generate the binary for each kernel and
    another compilation flow will generate the <<host>> code of the {cpp}
    <<sycl-application>>.
    For the full description please refer to <<subsec:sscp>>.
    See <<smcp>> for another approach.

[[string-kernel-name]]string kernel name::
    The name of a <<sycl-kernel-function>> in string form, this can be the name
    of a kernel function created via interop or a string form of a
    <<type-kernel-name>>.

[[sub-group]]sub-group::
    The SYCL sub-group ([code]#sycl::sub_group# class) is a representation of a
    collection of related work-items within a <<work-group>>.
    For further details for the [code]#sycl::sub_group# class see
    <<sub-group-class>>.

    A <<group-barrier>> for all <<work-item,work-items>> in a <<sub-group>>.

[[sub-group-mem-fence]]sub-group mem-fence::
    A <<mem-fence>> for all <<work-item,work-items>> in a <<sub-group>>.

[[sycl-application]]SYCL application::
    A SYCL application is a {cpp} application which uses the SYCL programming
    model in order to execute <<kernel,kernels>> on <<device,devices>>.

[[backend]]SYCL backend::
    An implementation of the SYCL programming model using an heterogeneous
    programming API.
    A SYCL backend exposes one or multiple SYCL <<platform,platforms>>.
    For example, the OpenCL backend, via the ICD loader, can expose multiple
    OpenCL <<platform,platforms>>.

[[backend-api]]SYCL backend API::
    The exposed API for writing SYCL code against a given <<backend>>.

[[sycl-library]]SYCL {cpp} template library::
    The template library is a set of {cpp} templated classes which provide the
    programming interface to the SYCL developer.

[[sycl-file]]SYCL file::
    A SYCL {cpp} source file that contains SYCL API calls.

[[sycl-kernel-function]]SYCL kernel function::
    A type which is callable with [code]#operator()# that takes an <<id>>,
    <<item>>, <<nd-item>> or <<work-group>>, and an optional
    [code]#kernel_handler# as its last parameter.
    This type can be passed to kernel enqueue member functions of the
    <<handler>>.
    A <<sycl-kernel-function>> defines an entry point to a <<kernel>>.
    The function object can be a named <<device-copyable>> type or lambda
    function.

[[sycl-runtime]]SYCL runtime::
    A SYCL runtime is an implementation of the SYCL API specification.
     The SYCL runtime manages the different <<platform,platforms>>,
     <<device,devices>>, <<context,contexts>> as well as memory
    handling of data between host and <<backend>> <<context,contexts>> to enable
    semantically correct execution of SYCL programs.

[[type-kernel-name]]type kernel name::
    The name of a <<sycl-kernel-function>> in type form, this can be either a
    <<kernel-name>> provided to a <<kernel-invocation-command>> or the type of a
    function object use as a <<sycl-kernel-function>>.

[[usm]]USM::
+
--
Unified Shared Memory (USM) provides a pointer-based alternative to the
<<buffer>> programming model.
USM enables:

  * easier integration into existing code bases by representing allocations as
    pointers rather than buffers, with full support for pointer arithmetic into
    allocations;
  * fine-grain control over ownership and accessibility of allocations, to
    optimally choose between performance and programmer convenience;
  * a simpler programming model, by automatically migrating some allocations
    between SYCL <<device,devices>> and the <<host>>.

See <<sec:usm>>
--

[[work-group]]work-group::
    The SYCL work-group ([code]#sycl::group# class) is a representation of a
    collection of related <<work-item,work-items>> that execute on a single
    compute unit.
    The <<work-item,work-items>> in the group execute the same kernel-instance
    and <<opencl12, share local memory and work-group functions>>.
    For further details for the [code]#sycl::group# class see <<group-class>>.

    A <<mem-fence>> for all <<work-item,work-items>> in a <<work-group>>.

[[work-group-id]]work-group id::
    As in OpenCL, SYCL kernels execute in <<work-group,work-groups>>.
    The group ID is the ID of the <<work-group>> that a <<work-item>> is
    executing within.
    A group ID is an one, two or three dimensional value that starts at 0 per
    dimension.

[[work-group-range]]work-group range::
    A group range is the size of the <<work-group>> for every dimension.

[[work-item]]work-item::
    The SYCL work-item is a representation of a <<work-item>> among a collection
    of parallel executions of a kernel invoked on a <<device>> by a <<command>>.
    A <<opencl12, work-item>> is executed by one or more processing elements as
    part of a <<work-group>> executing on a compute unit.
    A <<work-item>> is distinguished from other <<work-item,work-items>> by its
    <<global-id>> or the combination of its <<work-group-id>> and its
    <<local-id>> within a <<work-group>>.
