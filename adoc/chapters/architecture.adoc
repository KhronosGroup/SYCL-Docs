= SYCL architecture

This chapter describes the structure of a SYCL application, and how the SYCL
generic programming model lays out on top of a number of <<backend>>s.


== Overview

SYCL is an open industry standard for programming a heterogeneous system.
The design of SYCL allows standard {cpp} source code to be written such that it
can run on either an heterogeneous device or on the <<host>>.

The terminology used for SYCL inherits historically from OpenCL with some
SYCL-specific additions.
However SYCL is a generic {cpp} programming model that can be laid out on top of
other heterogeneous APIs apart from OpenCL.
SYCL implementations can provide <<backend>>s for various heterogeneous APIs,
implementing the SYCL general specification on top of them.
We refer to this heterogeneous API as the <<backend-api>>.
The SYCL general specification defines the behavior that all SYCL
implementations must expose to SYCL users for a SYCL application to behave as
expected.

A function object that can execute on a <<device>> exposed by a <<backend-api>>
is called a <<sycl-kernel-function>>.

To ensure maximum interoperability with different <<backend-api>>s, software
developers can access the <<backend-api>> alongside the SYCL general API
whenever they include the <<backend>> interoperability headers.
However, interoperability is a <<backend>>-specific feature.
An application that uses interoperability does not conform to the SYCL general
application model, since it is not portable across backends.

// Note below I leave the reference to OpenCL intentionally

The target users of SYCL are {cpp} programmers who want all the performance and
portability features of a standard like OpenCL, but with the flexibility to use
higher-level {cpp} abstractions across the host/device code boundary.
Developers can use most of the abstraction features of {cpp}, such as templates,
classes and operator overloading.

However, some {cpp} language features are not permitted inside kernels, due to
the limitations imposed by the capabilities of the underlying heterogeneous
platforms.
These features include virtual functions, virtual inheritance, throwing/catching
exceptions, and run-time type-information.
These features are available outside kernels as normal.
Within these constraints, developers can use abstractions defined by SYCL, or
they can develop their own on top.
These capabilities make SYCL ideal for library developers, middleware providers
and application developers who want to separate low-level highly-tuned
algorithms or data structures that work on heterogeneous systems from
higher-level software development.
Software developers can produce templated algorithms that are easily usable by
developers in other fields.


[[sec:anatomy]]
== Anatomy of a SYCL application

Below is an example of a typical <<sycl-application>> which schedules a job to
run in parallel on any heterogeneous device available.

// An AsciiDoctor "feature", the language is specified as the second
// parameter of this attribute, even if we do not want it. So add a
// empty language with ",," so the highlighter can go on using the
// language specified in ":source-highlighter:"
[source,,linenums]
----
include::{code_dir}/anatomy.cpp[lines=4..-1]
----

At line 1, we [code]#{hash}include# the SYCL header files, which provide all of
the SYCL features that will be used.

A SYCL application runs on a <<sec:platformmodel, SYCL Platform>>.
The application is structured in three scopes which specify the different
sections; <<application-scope>>, <<command-group-scope>> and <<kernel-scope>>.
The <<kernel-scope>> specifies a single kernel function that will be, or has
been, compiled by a <<device-compiler>> and executed on a <<device>>.
In this example <<kernel-scope>> is defined by lines 25 to 26.
The <<command-group-scope>> specifies a unit of work which is comprised of a
<<sycl-kernel-function>> and <<accessor,accessors>>.
In this example <<command-group-scope>> is defined by lines 20 to 28.
The <<application-scope>> specifies all other code outside of a
<<command-group-scope>>.
These three scopes are used to control the application flow and the construction
and lifetimes of the various objects used within SYCL, as explained in
<<sec:managing-object-lifetimes>>.

A <<sycl-kernel-function>> is the scoped block of code that will be compiled
using a device compiler.
This code may be defined by the body of a lambda function or by the
[code]#operator()# function of a function object.
Each instance of the <<sycl-kernel-function>> will be executed as a single,
though not necessarily entirely independent, flow of execution and has to adhere
to restrictions on what operations may be allowed to enable device compilers to
safely compile it to a range of underlying devices.

The [code]#parallel_for# member function can be templated with a class.
This class is used to manually name the kernel when desired, such as to avoid a
compiler-generated name when debugging a kernel defined through a lambda, to
provide a known name with which to apply build options to a kernel, or to ensure
compatibility with multiple compiler-pass implementations.

The [code]#parallel_for# member function creates an instance of a <<kernel>>,
which is the entity that will be enqueued within a command group.
In the case of [code]#parallel_for# the <<sycl-kernel-function>> will be
executed over the given range from 0 to 1023.
The different member functions to execute kernels can be found in
<<subsec:invokingkernels>>.

A <<command-group-scope>> is the syntactic scope wrapped by the construction of
a <<command-group-function-object>> as seen on line 19.
The <<command-group-function-object>> may invoke only a single
<<sycl-kernel-function>>, and it takes a parameter of type command group
[code]#handler#, which is constructed by the runtime.

All the requirements for a kernel to execute are defined in this
<<command-group-scope>>, as described in <<sec:executionmodel>>.
In this case the constructor used for [code]#myQueue# on line 9 is the default
constructor, which allows the queue to select the best underlying device to
execute on, leaving the decision up to the runtime.

In SYCL, data that is required within a <<sycl-kernel-function>> must be
contained within a <<buffer>>, <<image>>, or <<usm>> allocation, as described in
<<sec:memory.model>>.
We construct a buffer on line 16.
Access to the <<buffer>> is controlled via an <<accessor>> which is constructed
on line 21.
The <<buffer>> is used to keep track of access to the data and the <<accessor>>
is used to request access to the data on a queue, as well as to track the
dependencies between <<sycl-kernel-function>>.
In this example the <<accessor>> is used to write to the data buffer on line 26.


[[sec:normativerefs]]
== Normative references

// Jon: are any of the OpenCL specifications normative? They are also
// referred to from the SYCL spec, and some of the definitions appear to be
// required.

The documents in the following list are referred to within this SYCL
specification, and their content is a requirement for this document.

  . *{cpp17}:* <<cpp17, ISO/IEC 14882:2017 Clauses 1-19>>, referred to in this
    specification as the {cpp} core language.
    The SYCL specification refers to language in the following {cpp} defect
    reports and assumes a compiler that implements them: <<dr2325, DR2325>>.
  . *{cpp20}:* <<cpp20, ISO/IEC 14882:2020
Programming languages â€” {cpp}>>, referred to in this specification as the next
{cpp} specification.

[[sec:nonnormativerefs]]
== Non-normative notes and examples

Unless stated otherwise, text within this SYCL specification is normative and
defines the required behavior of a SYCL implementation.
Non-normative / informational notes are included within this specification using
a "`note`" callout, of the form:

[NOTE]
====
Information within a note callout, such as this text, is for informational
purposes and does not impose requirements on or specify behavior of a SYCL
implementation.
====

Source code examples within the specification are provided to aid with
understanding, and are non-normative.

In case of any conflict between a non-normative note or source example, and
normative text within the specification, the normative text must be taken to be
correct.

[[sec:platformmodel]]
== The SYCL platform model

The SYCL platform model consists of a host connected to one or more
heterogeneous devices, called <<device,devices>>.
<<device,Devices>> are grouped together into one or multiple <<platform,
platforms>>.
An implementation may also expose empty <<platform, platforms>> that do not
contain any <<device,devices>>.

A SYCL <<context>> is constructed, either directly by the user or implicitly
when creating a <<queue>>, to hold all the runtime information required by the
SYCL runtime and the <<backend>> to operate on a device, or group of devices.
When a group of devices can be grouped together on the same context, they have
some visibility of each other's memory objects.
The SYCL runtime can assume that memory is visible across all devices in the
same <<context>>.
Not all devices exposed from the same <<platform>> can be grouped together in
the same <<context>>.

A SYCL application executes on the host as a standard {cpp} program.
<<device,Devices>> are exposed through different <<backend, SYCL backends>> to
the SYCL application.
The SYCL application submits <<command-group-function-object,command group
function objects>> to <<queue,queues>>.
Each <<queue>> enables execution on a given device.

The <<sycl-runtime>> then extracts operations from the
<<command-group-function-object>>, e.g. an explicit copy operation or a
<<sycl-kernel-function>>.
When the operation is a <<sycl-kernel-function>>, the <<sycl-runtime>> uses a
<<backend>>-specific mechanism to extract the device binary from the SYCL
application and pass it to the heterogeneous API for execution on the
<<device>>.

A SYCL <<device>> is divided into one or more compute units (CUs) which are each
divided into one or more processing elements (PEs).
Computations on a device occur within the processing elements.
How computation is mapped to PEs is <<backend>> and <<device>> specific.
Two devices exposed via two different backends can map computations differently
to the same device.

When a SYCL application contains <<sycl-kernel-function>> objects, the SYCL
implementation must provide an offline compilation mechanism that enables the
integration of the device binaries into the SYCL application.
The output of the offline compiler can be an intermediate representation, such
as SPIR-V, that will be finalized during execution or a final device ISA.

A device may expose special purpose functionality as a _built-in_ function.
The SYCL API exposes functions to query and dispatch said _built-in_ functions.
Some <<backend, SYCL backends>> and <<device,devices>> may not support
programmable kernels, and only support _built-in_ functions.
// TODO: Conformance of these custom-devices?


== The SYCL backend model

SYCL is a generic programming model for the {cpp} language that can target
multiple heterogeneous APIs, such as OpenCL.

SYCL implementations enable these target APIs by implementing <<backend, SYCL
backends>>.
For a SYCL implementation to be conformant on said <<backend>>, it must execute
the SYCL generic programming model on the backend.
All SYCL implementations must provide at least one backend.

The present document covers the SYCL generic interface available to all
<<backend, SYCL backends>>.
How the SYCL generic interface maps to a particular <<backend>> is defined
either by a separate <<backend>> specification document, provided by the Khronos
SYCL group, or by the SYCL implementation documentation.
Whenever there is a <<backend>> specification document, this takes precedence
over SYCL implementation documentation.

When a SYCL user builds their SYCL application, she decides which of the
<<backend, SYCL backends>> will be used to build the SYCL application.
This is called the set of _active backends_.
Implementations must ensure that the active backends selected by the user can be
used simultaneously by the SYCL implementation at runtime.
If two backends are available at compile time but will produce an invalid SYCL
application at runtime, the SYCL implementation must emit a compilation error.

A SYCL application built with a number of active backends does not necessarily
guarantee that said backends can be executed at runtime.
The subset of active backends available at runtime is called _available
backends_.
A backend is said to be _available_ if the host platform where the SYCL
application is executed exposes support for the heterogeneous API required for
the <<backend>>.

It is implementation dependent whether certain backends require third-party
libraries to be available in the system.
Failure to have all dependencies required for all active backends at runtime
will cause the SYCL application to not run.

Once the application is running, users can query what SYCL platforms are
available.
SYCL implementations will expose the devices provided by each backend grouped
into platforms.
A backend must expose at least one platform.

Under the <<backend>> model, SYCL objects can contain one or multiple references
to a certain <<backend>> native type.
Not all SYCL objects will map directly to a <<backend>> native type.
The mapping of SYCL objects to <<backend>> native types is defined by the
<<backend>> specification document when available, or by the SYCL implementation
otherwise.

To guarantee that multiple <<backend>> objects can interoperate with each other,
SYCL memory objects are not bound to a particular <<backend>>.
SYCL memory objects can be accessed from any device exposed by an _available_
backend.
SYCL Implementations can potentially map SYCL memory objects to multiple native
types in different <<backend, SYCL backends>>.

Since SYCL memory objects are independent of any particular <<backend>>, SYCL
<<command-group,command groups>> can request access to memory objects allocated
by any <<backend>>, and execute it on the backend associated with the <<queue>>.
This requires the SYCL implementation to be able to transfer memory objects
across <<backend, SYCL backends>>.

USM allocations are subject to the limitations described in <<sec:usm>>.

When a SYCL application runs on any number of <<backend, SYCL backends>> without
relying on any <<backend>>-specific behavior or interoperability, it is said to
be a SYCL general application, and it is expected to run in any SYCL-conformant
implementation that supports the required features for the application.


=== Platform mixed version support

The SYCL generic programming model exposes a number of <<platform,platforms>>,
each of them either empty or exposing a number of <<device,devices>>.
Each <<platform>> is bound to a certain <<backend>>.
SYCL <<device,devices>> associated with said <<platform>> are associated with
that <<backend>>.

Although the APIs in the SYCL generic programming model are defined according to
this specification and their version is indicated by the macro
[code]#SYCL_LANGUAGE_VERSION#, this does not apply to APIs exposed by the
<<backend, SYCL backends>>.
Each <<backend>> provides its own document that defines its APIs, and that
document tells how to query for the device and platform versions.


== SYCL execution model

As described in <<sec:anatomy>>, a <<sycl-application>> is comprised of three
scopes: <<application-scope>>, <<command-group-scope>>, and <<kernel-scope>>.
Code in the <<application-scope>> and <<command-group-scope>> runs on the host
and is governed by the _SYCL application execution model_.
Code in the kernel scope runs on a device and is governed by the _SYCL kernel
execution model_.

[NOTE]
====
A SYCL device does not necessarily correspond to a physical accelerator.
A SYCL implementation may choose to expose some or all of the host's resources
as a SYCL device; such an implementation would execute code in <<kernel-scope>>
on the host, but that code would still be governed by the _SYCL kernel execution
model_.
====


[[sec:executionmodel]]
=== SYCL application execution model

The SYCL application defines the execution order of the kernels by grouping each
kernel with its requirements into a <<command-group-function-object>>.
<<command-group-function-object,Command group function objects>> are submitted
for execution via a <<queue>> object, which defines the device where the kernel
will run.
This specification sometimes refers to this as "`submitting the kernel to a
device`".
The same <<command-group>> object can be submitted to different queues.
When a <<command-group>> is submitted to a SYCL <<queue>>, the requirements of
the kernel execution are captured.
The implementation can start executing a kernel as soon as its requirements have
been satisfied.

==== Backend resources managed by the SYCL application

The SYCL runtime integrated with the SYCL application will manage the resources
required by the <<backend-api>> to manage the heterogeneous devices it is
providing access to.
This includes, but is not limited to, resource handlers, memory pools, dispatch
queues and other temporary handler objects.

The SYCL programming interface represents the lifetime of the resources managed
by the SYCL application using RAII rules.
Construction of a SYCL object will typically entail the creation of multiple
<<backend>> objects, which will be properly released on destruction of said SYCL
object.
The overall rules for construction and destruction are detailed in
<<chapter:sycl-programming-interface>>.
Those <<backend, SYCL backends>> with a <<backend>> document will detail how the
resource management from SYCL objects map down to the <<backend>> objects.

In SYCL, the minimum required object for submitting work to devices is the
<<queue>>, which contains references to a <<platform>>, <<device>> and a
<<context>> internally.

The resources managed by SYCL are:

// Note enumerate below was meant originally to showcase SYCL features
// for each OpenCL resource, this is now re-worded to cover for a
// general case of what resources are managed.
// Also, references to the SYCL API are removed to make text independent
// from changes in the programming

  . <<platform,Platforms>>: all features of <<backend-api>>s are implemented by
    platforms.
    A platform can be viewed as a given vendor's runtime and the devices
    accessible through it.
    Some devices will only be accessible to one vendor's runtime and hence
    multiple platforms may be present.
    SYCL manages the different platforms for the user which are accessible
    through a [code]#sycl::platform# object.
    In some cases, an implementation might also choose to expose empty
    [code]#sycl::platform# objects, for example if a vendor's runtime is
    available, but no devices supported by that runtime are available in the
    system.
  . <<context,Contexts>>: any <<backend>> resource that is acquired by the user
    is attached to a context.
    A context contains a collection of devices that the host can use and manages
    memory objects that can be shared between the devices.
    Devices belonging to the same <<context>> must be able to access each
    other's global memory using some implementation-specific mechanism.
    A given context can only wrap devices owned by a single platform.
    A context is exposed to the user with a [code]#sycl::context# object.
  . <<device,Devices>>: platforms may provide devices for executing SYCL
    kernels.
    In SYCL, a device is accessible through a [code]#sycl::device# object.
  . <<kernel,Kernels>>: the SYCL functions that run on SYCL devices are defined
    as {cpp} function objects (a named function object type or a lambda
    function).
    A kernel can be introspected through a [code]#sycl::kernel# object.
+
--
Note that some <<backend, SYCL backends>> may expose non-programmable
functionality as pre-defined kernels.
--
  . <<kernel-bundle,Kernel bundles>>: Kernels are stored internally in the SYCL
    application as device images, and these device images can be grouped into a
    [code]#sycl::kernel_bundle# object.
    These objects provide a way for the application to control the online
    compilation of kernels for devices.
  . <<queue,Queues>>: SYCL kernels execute in command queues.
    The user must create a [code]#sycl::queue# object, which references an
    associated context, platform and device.
    The context, platform and device may be chosen automatically, or specified
    by the user.
    SYCL queues execute <<kernel,kernels>> on a particular device of a
    particular context, but can have dependencies from any device on any
    available <<backend>>.

The SYCL implementation guarantees the correct initialization and destruction of
any resource handled by the underlying <<backend-api>>, except for those the
user has obtained manually via the SYCL interoperability API.

[[sec:command-groups-exec-order]]
==== SYCL command groups and execution order

By default, SYCL queues execute kernel functions in an out-of-order fashion
based on dependency information.
Developers only need to specify what data is required to execute a particular
kernel.
The SYCL runtime will guarantee that kernels are executed in an order that
guarantees correctness.
By specifying access modes and types of memory, a directed acyclic dependency
graph (DAG) of kernels is built at runtime.
This is achieved via the usage of <<command-group>> objects.
A SYCL <<command-group>> object defines a set of requisites (_R_) and a kernel
function (_k_).
A <<command-group>> is _submitted_ to a queue when using the
[code]#sycl::queue::submit# member function.

A *requisite* (_r~i~_) is a requirement that must be fulfilled for a
kernel-function (_k_) to be executed on a particular device.
For example, a requirement may be that certain data is available on a device, or
that another command group has finished execution.
An implementation may evaluate the requirements of a command group at any point
after it has been submitted.
The _processing of a command group_ is the process by which a SYCL runtime
evaluates all the requirements in a given _R_.
The SYCL runtime will execute _k_ only when all _r~i~_ are satisfied (i.e., when
all requirements are satisfied).
To simplify the notation, in the specification we refer to the set of
requirements of a command group named _foo_ as _CG~foo~ = r~1~, {ldots}, r~n~_.

The _evaluation of a requisite_ ({SYCLeval}(_r~i~_)) returns the status of the
requisite, which can be _True_ or _False_.
A _satisfied_ requisite implies the requirement is met.
{SYCLeval}(_r~i~_) never alters the requisite, only observes the current status.
The implementation may not block to check the requisite, and the same check can
be performed multiple times.

An *action* (_a~i~_) is a collection of implementation-defined operations that
must be performed in order to satisfy a requisite.
The set of actions for a given <<command-group>> _A_ is permitted to be empty if
no operation is required to satisfy the requirement.
The notation _a~i~_ represents the action required to satisfy _r~i~_.
Actions of different requisites can be satisfied in any order with respect to
each other without side effects (i.e., given two requirements _r~j~_ and _r~k~_,
_(r~j~, r~k~)_ {equiv} _(r~k~, r~j~)_).
The intersection of two actions is not necessarily empty.
*Actions* can include (but are not limited to): memory copy operations, memory
mapping operations, coordination with the host, or implementation-specific
behavior.

Finally, _Performing an action_ ({SYCLperform}(_a~i~_)) executes the action
operations required to satisfy the requisite _r~j~_.
Note that, after {SYCLperform}(_a~i~_), the evaluation {SYCLeval}(_r~j~_) will
return _True_ until the kernel is executed.
After the kernel execution, it is not defined whether a different
<<command-group>> with the same requirements needs to perform the action again,
where actions of different requisites inside the same <<command-group>> object
can be satisfied in any order with respect to each other without side effects:
Given two requirements _r~j~_ and _r~k~_, {SYCLperform}(_a~j~_) followed by
{SYCLperform}(_a~k~_) is equivalent to {SYCLperform}(_a~k~_) followed by
{SYCLperform}(_a~j~_).

The requirements of different <<command-group,command groups>> submitted to the
same or different queues are evaluated in the relative order of submission.
<<command-group>> objects whose intersection of requirement sets is not empty
are said to depend on each other.
They are executed in order of submission to the queue.
If <<command-group,command groups>> are submitted to different queues or by
multiple threads, the order of execution is determined by the SYCL runtime.
Note that independent <<command-group>> objects can be submitted simultaneously
without affecting dependencies.

<<fig:three-cg-one-queue>> illustrates the execution order of three
<<command-group>> objects (_CG~a~,CG~b~,CG~c~_) with certain requirements
submitted to the same queue.
Both _CG~a~_ and _CG~b~_ only have one requirement, _r~1~_ and _r~2~_
respectively.
_CG~c~_ requires both _r~1~_ and _r~2~_.
This enables the SYCL runtime to potentially execute _CG~a~_ and _CG~b~_
simultaneously, whereas _CG~c~_ cannot be executed until both _CG~a~_ and
_CG~b~_ have been completed.
The SYCL runtime evaluates the *requisites* and performs the *actions* required
(if any) for the _CG~a~_ and _CG~b~_.
When evaluating the *requisites* of _CG~c~_, they will be satisfied once the
_CG~a~_ and _CG~b~_ have finished.

<<fig:three-cg-three-queue>> uses three separate SYCL queue objects to submit
the same <<command-group>> objects as before.
Regardless of using three different queues, the execution order of the different
<<command-group>> objects is the same.
When different threads enqueue to different queues, the execution order of the
command group will be the order in which the submit member functions are
executed.
In this case, since the different <<command-group>> objects execute on different
devices, the *actions* required to satisfy the *requirements* may be different
(e.g, the SYCL runtime may need to copy data to a different device in a separate
context).

==== Controlling execution order with events

Submitting an action for execution returns an [code]#event# object.
Programmers may use these events to explicitly coordinate host and device
execution.
Host code can wait for an event to complete, which will block execution on the
host until the action(s) represented by the event have completed.
The [code]#event# class is described in greater detail in
<<sec:interface.event>>.

Events may also be used to explicitly order the execution of kernels.
Host code may wait for the completion of specific event, which blocks execution
on the host until that event's action has completed.
Events may also define requisites between <<command-group,command groups>>.
Using events in this manner informs the runtime that one or more
<<command-group,command groups>> must complete before another <<command-group>>
may begin executing.
See <<sub.section.requirement>> for greater detail.

=== SYCL kernel execution model

When a kernel is submitted for execution, an index space is defined.
An instance of the kernel body executes for each point in this index space.
This kernel instance is called a <<work-item>> and is identified by its point in
the index space, which provides a <<global-id>> for the work-item.
Each work-item executes the same code but the specific execution pathway through
the code and the data operated upon can vary by using the work-item global id to
specialize the computation.

An index space of size zero is allowed.
All aspects of kernel execution proceed as normal with the exception that the
kernel function itself is not executed.
Note this means the command queue will still schedule this kernel after
satisfying the requirements and this satisfies requirements of any dependent
enqueued kernels.

==== Basic kernels

SYCL allows a simple execution model in which a kernel is invoked over an
_N_-dimensional index space defined by [code]#range<N>#, where _N_ is one, two
or three.
Each work-item in such a kernel executes independently.

Each work-item is identified by a value of type [code]#item<N>#.
The type [code]#item<N># encapsulates a work-item identifier of type
[code]#id<N># and a [code]#range<N># representing the number of work-items
executing the kernel.

==== ND-range kernels

Work-items can be organized into <<work-group,work-groups>>, providing a more
coarse-grained decomposition of the index space.
Each work-group is assigned a unique <<work-group-id>> with the same
dimensionality as the index space used for the work-items.
Work-items are each assigned a <<local-id>>, unique within the work-group, so
that a single work-item can be uniquely identified by its global id or by a
combination of its local id and work-group id.
The work-items in a given work-group execute on the processing elements of a
single compute unit.

When work-groups are used in SYCL, the index space is called an <<nd-range>>.
An ND-range is an _N_-dimensional index space, where _N_ is one, two or three.
In SYCL, the ND-range is represented via the [code]#nd_range<N># class.
An [code]#nd_range<N># is made up of a global range and a local range, each
represented via values of type [code]#range<N>#.
Additionally, there can be a global offset, represented via a value of type
[code]#id<N>#; this is deprecated in SYCL 2020.
The types [code]#range<N># and [code]#id<N># are each _N_-element arrays of
integers.
The iteration space defined via an [code]#nd_range<N># is an _N_-dimensional
index space starting at the ND-range's global offset whose size is its global
range, split into work-groups of the size of its local range.

Each work-item in the ND-range is identified by a value of type
[code]#nd_item<N>#.
The type [code]#nd_item<N># encapsulates a global id, local id and work-group
id, all of type [code]#id<N># (the iteration space offset also of type
[code]#id<N>#, but this is deprecated in SYCL 2020), as well as global and local
ranges and coordination mechanisms necessary to make work-groups useful.
Work-groups are assigned ids using a similar approach to that used for work-item
global ids.
Work-items are assigned to a work-group and given a local id with components in
the range from zero to the size of the work-group in that dimension minus one.
Hence, the combination of a work-group id and the local id within a work-group
uniquely defines a work-item.

==== Backend-specific kernels

SYCL allows a <<backend, SYCL backend>> to expose fixed functionality as
non-programmable built-in kernels.
The availability and behavior of these built-in kernels are
<<backend>>-specific, and are not required to follow the SYCL execution and
memory models.
Furthermore the interface exposed utilize these built-in kernels is also
<<backend>>-specific.
See the relevant backend specification for details.

[[sec:memory.model]]
== Memory model

Since SYCL is a single-source programming model, the memory model affects both
the application and the device kernel parts of a program.
On the SYCL application, the SYCL runtime will make sure data is available for
execution of the kernels.
On the SYCL device kernel, the <<backend>> rules describing how the memory
behaves on a specific device are mapped to SYCL {cpp} constructs.
Thus it is possible to program kernels efficiently in pure {cpp}.


[[sub.section.memmodel.app]]
=== SYCL application memory model

The application running on the host uses SYCL <<buffer>> objects using instances
of the [code]#sycl::buffer# class or <<usm>> allocation functions to allocate
memory in the global address space, or can allocate specialized image memory
using the [code]#sycl::unsampled_image# and [code]#sycl::sampled_image# classes.

In the SYCL application, memory objects are bound to all devices in which they
are used, regardless of the SYCL context where they reside.
SYCL memory objects (namely, <<buffer>> and <<image>> objects) can encapsulate
multiple underlying <<backend>> memory objects together with multiple host
memory allocations to enable the same object to be shared between devices in
different contexts, platforms or backends.
<<usm>> allocations uniquely identify a memory allocation and are bound to a
SYCL context.
They are only valid on the backend used by the context.

The order of execution of <<command-group>> objects ensures a sequentially
consistent access to the memory from the different devices to the memory
objects.
Accessing a USM allocation does not alter the order of execution.
Users must explicitly inform the SYCL runtime of any requirements necessary for
a legal execution.

To access a memory object, the user must create an <<accessor>> object which
parameterizes the type of access to the memory object that a kernel or the host
requires.
The <<accessor>> object defines a requirement to access a memory object, and
this requirement is defined by construction of an accessor, regardless of
whether there are any uses in a kernel or by the host.
An accessor object specifies whether the access is via global memory, constant
memory or image samplers and their associated access functions.
The <<accessor>> also specifies whether the access is read-only (RO), write-only
(WO) or read-write (RW).
An optional [code]#no_init# property can be added to an accessor to tell the
system to discard any previous contents of the data the accessor refers to, so
there are two additional requirement types: no-init-write-only (NWO) and
no-init-read-write (NRW).
For simplicity, when a *requisite* represents an accessor object in a certain
access mode, we represent it as MemoryObject~AccessMode~.
For example, an accessor that accesses memory object *buf1* in *RW* mode is
represented as _buf1~RW~_.
A <<command-group>> object that uses such an accessor is represented as
_CG(buf1~RW~)_.
The *action* required to satisfy a requisite and the location of the latest copy
of a memory object will vary depending on the implementation.

<<fig:devicetodevice>> illustrates an example where <<command-group>> objects
are enqueued to two separate SYCL queues executing in devices in different
contexts.
The *requisites* for the <<command-group>> execution are the same, but the
*actions* to satisfy them are different.
For example, if the data is on the host before execution, _A(b1~RW~)_ and
_A(b2~RW~)_ can potentially be implemented as copy operations from the host
memory to [code]#context1# or [code]#context2# respectively.
After _CG~a~_ and _CG~b~_ are executed, _A'(b1~RW~)_ will likely be an empty
operation, since the result of the kernel can stay on the device.
On the other hand, the results of _CG~b~_ are now on a different context than
_CG~c~_ is executing, therefore _A'(b2~RW~)_ will need to copy data across two
separate contexts using an implementation specific mechanism.

<<fig:devicetodevice>> shows actions performed when three command groups are
submitted to two distinct queues, and potential implementation in an OpenCL
<<backend>> by a SYCL runtime.
Note that in this example, each SYCL buffer (_b2,b2_) is implemented as separate
[code]#cl_mem# objects per context.

Note that the order of the definition of the accessors within the
<<command-group>> is irrelevant to the requirements they define.
All accessors always apply to the entire <<command-group>> object where they are
defined.

When multiple <<accessor,accessors>> in the same <<command-group>> define
different requisites to the same memory object these requisites must be
resolved.

Firstly, any requisites with different access modes but the same access target
are resolved into a single requisite with the union of the different access
modes according to <<table.access.mode.union>>.
The atomic access mode acts as if it was read-write (RW) when determining the
combined requirement.
The rules in <<table.access.mode.union>> are commutative and associative.

| write (WO)               | read-write (RW)          | read-write (RW)
| no-init-write (NWO)      | no-init-read-write (NRW) | no-init-read-write (NRW)
| no-init-write (NWO)      | write (WO)               | write (WO)
| no-init-write (NWO)      | read (RO)                | read-write (RW)
| no-init-write (NWO)      | read-write (RW)          | read-write (RW)
| no-init-read-write (NRW) | write (WO)               | read-write (RW)

| no-init-read-write (NRW) | read-write (RW)          | read-write (RW)
|====

The result of this should be that there should not be any requisites with the
same access target.

Secondly, the remaining requisites must adhere to the following rule.
Only one of the requisites may have write access (_W_ or _RW_), otherwise the
<<sycl-runtime>> must throw an exception.
All requisites create a requirement for the data they represent to be made
available in the specified access target, however only the requisite with write
access determines the side effects of the <<command-group>>, i.e. only the data
which that requisite represents will be updated.

For example:

  * _CG(b1^G^~RW~, b1^H^~R~)_ is permitted.
  * _CG(b1^G^~RW~, b1^H^~RW~)_ is *not* permitted.
  * _CG(b1^G^~W~, b1^C^~RW~)_ is *not* permitted.

Where _G_ and _C_ correspond to a [code]#target::device# and
[code]#target::constant_buffer# accessor and _H_ corresponds to a host accessor.

A buffer created from a range of an existing buffer is called a
[keyword]#sub-buffer#.
A buffer may be overlaid with any number of sub-buffers.
Accessors can be created to operate on these [keyword]#sub-buffers#.
Refer to <<subsec:buffers>> for details on [keyword]#sub-buffer# creation and
restrictions.
A requirement to access a sub-buffer is represented by specifying its range,
e.g. _CG(b1~RW,[0,5)~)_ represents the requirement of accessing the range
_[0,5)_ buffer _b1_ in read write mode.

If two accessors are constructed to access the same buffer, but both are to
non-overlapping sub-buffers of the buffer, then the two accessors are said to
not [keyword]#overlap#, otherwise the accessors do overlap.
Overlapping is the test that is used to determine the scheduling order of
command groups.
Command-groups with non-overlapping requirements may execute concurrently.

// Formerly in overlap.tex
// Uses same definitions for cga, cgb, and cgc in code and picture,
// but they're marked up in different languages, so no sharing is possible.

It is permissible for command groups that only read data to not copy that data
back to the host or other devices after reading and for the runtime to maintain
multiple read-only copies of the data on multiple devices.

A special case of requirement is the one defined by a *host accessor*.
Host accessors are represented with _H(MemoryObject~AccessMode~)_, e.g,
_H(b1~RW~)_ represents a host accessor to _b1_ in read-write mode.
Host accessors are a special type of accessor constructed from a memory object
outside a command group, and require that the data associated with the given
memory object is available on the host in the given pointer.
This causes the runtime to block on construction of this object until the
requirement has been satisfied.
*Host accessor* objects are effectively barriers on all accesses to a certain
memory object.
<<fig:host-acc>> shows an example of multiple command groups enqueued to the
same queue.
Once the host accessor _H(b1~RW~)_ is reached, the execution cannot proceed
until _CG~a~_ is finished.
However, _CG~b~_ does not have any requirements on _b1_, therefore, it can
execute concurrently with the barrier.
Finally, _CG~c~_ will be enqueued after _H(b1~RW~)_ is finished, but still has
to wait for _CG~b~_ to conclude for all its requirements to be satisfied.
See <<sec:coordination>> for details on host-device coordination.

=== SYCL device memory model

The memory model for SYCL devices is based on the OpenCL 1.2 memory model.
Work-items executing in a kernel have access to three distinct address spaces
(memory regions) and a virtual address space overlapping some concrete address
spaces:

  * <<global-memory,Global-memory>> is accessible to all work-items in all
    work-groups.
    Work-items can read from or write to any element of a global memory object.
    Reads and writes to global memory may be cached depending on the
    capabilities of the device.
    Global memory is persistent across kernel invocations.
    Concurrent access to a location in an USM allocation by two or more
    executing kernels where at least one kernel modifies that location is a data
    race; there is no guarantee of correct results unless <<mem-fence>> and
    atomic operations are used.
  * <<local-memory,Local-memory>> is accessible to all work-items in a single
    work-group.
    Attempting to access local memory in one work-group from another work-group
    results in undefined behavior.
    This memory region can be used to allocate variables that are shared by all
    work-items in a work-group.
    Work-group-level visibility allows local memory to be implemented as
    dedicated regions of the device memory where this is appropriate.
  * <<private-memory,Private-memory>> is a region of memory private to a
    work-item.
    Attempting to access private memory in one work-item from another work-item
    results in undefined behavior.
  * <<generic-memory,Generic-memory>> is a virtual address space which overlaps
    the global, local and private address spaces.
    Therefore, an object that resides in the global, local, or private address
    space can also be accessed through the generic address space.

==== Access to memory

Accessors in the device kernels provide access to the memory objects, acting as
pointers to the corresponding address space.

Pointers can be passed directly as kernel arguments if an implementation
supports <<usm>>.
See <<sec:usm>> for information on when it is legal to dereference pointers
passed from the host inside kernels.

To allocate local memory within a kernel, the user can either pass a
[code]#sycl::local_accessor# object as a argument to an ND-range kernel (that
has a user-defined work-group size), or can define a variable in work-group
scope inside [code]#sycl::parallel_for_work_group#.

Any variable defined inside a [code]#sycl::parallel_for# scope or
[code]#sycl::parallel_for_work_item# scope will be allocated in private memory.
Any variable defined inside a [code]#sycl::parallel_for_work_group# scope will
be allocated in local memory.

Users can create accessors that reference sub-buffers as well as entire buffers.

Within kernels, the underlying {cpp} pointer types can be obtained from an
accessor.
The pointer types will contain a compile-time deduced address space.
So, for example, if a {cpp} pointer is obtained from an accessor to global
memory, the {cpp} pointer type will have a global address space attribute
attached to it.
The address space attribute will be compile-time propagated to other pointer
values when one pointer is initialized to another pointer value using a defined
algorithm.

When developers need to explicitly state the address space of a pointer value,
one of the explicit pointer classes can be used.
There is a different explicit pointer class for each address space:
[code]#sycl::raw_local_ptr#, [code]#sycl::raw_global_ptr#,
[code]#sycl::raw_private_ptr#, [code]#sycl::raw_generic_ptr#,
[code]#sycl::decorated_local_ptr#, [code]#sycl::decorated_global_ptr#,
[code]#sycl::decorated_private_ptr#, or [code]#sycl::decorated_generic_ptr#.

The classes with the [code]#decorated# prefix expose pointers that use an
implementation-defined address space decoration, while the classes with the
[code]#raw# prefix do not.
Buffer accessors with an access target [code]#target::device# or
[code]#target::constant_buffer# and local accessors can be converted into
explicit pointer classes ([code]#multi_ptr#).

For templates that need to adapt to different address spaces, a
[code]#sycl::multi_ptr# class is defined which is templated via a compile-time
constant enumerator value to specify the address space.

[[sec:memoryconsistency]]
=== SYCL memory consistency model

The SYCL memory consistency model is based upon the memory consistency model of
the {cpp} core language.
Where SYCL offers extensions to classes and functions that may affect memory
consistency, the default behavior when these extensions are not used always
matches the behavior of standard {cpp}.

A SYCL implementation must guarantee that the same memory consistency model is
used across host and device code.
Every <<device-compiler>> must support the memory model defined by the minimum
version of {cpp} described in <<sec:progmodel.minimumcppversion>>; SYCL
implementations supporting additional versions of {cpp} must also support the
corresponding memory models.

Within a work-item, operations are ordered according to the _sequenced before_
relation defined by the {cpp} core language.

Ensuring memory consistency across different work-items requires careful usage
of <<group-barrier>> operations, <<mem-fence>> operations and atomic operations.
The ordering of operations across different work-items is determined by the
_happens before_ relation defined by the {cpp} core language, with a single
relation governing all address spaces (memory regions).

On any SYCL device, local and global memory may be made consistent across
work-items in a single <<group>> through use of a <<group-barrier>> operation.
On SYCL devices supporting acquire-release or sequentially consistent memory
orderings, all memory visible to a set of work-items may be made consistent
across the work-items in that set through the use of <<mem-fence>> and atomic
operations.

Memory consistency between the host and SYCL device(s), or different SYCL
devices in the same context, can be guaranteed through library calls in the host
application, as defined in <<sec:coordination>>.
On SYCL devices supporting concurrent atomic accesses to USM allocations and
acquire-release or sequentially consistent memory orderings, cross-device memory
consistency can be enforced through the use of <<mem-fence>> and atomic
operations.

[[sec:memory-ordering]]
==== Memory ordering

[source,,linenums]
----
include::{header_dir}/memoryOrder.h[lines=4..-1]
----

The memory synchronization order of a given atomic operation is controlled by a
[code]#sycl::memory_order# parameter, which can take one of the following
values:

  * [code]#sycl::memory_order::relaxed#;
  * [code]#sycl::memory_order::acquire#;
  * [code]#sycl::memory_order::release#;
  * [code]#sycl::memory_order::acq_rel#;
  * [code]#sycl::memory_order::seq_cst#.

The meanings of these values are identical to those defined in the {cpp} core
language.

These memory orders are listed above from weakest
([code]#memory_order::relaxed#) to strongest ([code]#memory_order::seq_cst#).

The complete set of memory orders is not guaranteed to be supported by every
device, nor across all combinations of devices within a platform.
The set of supported memory orders can be queried via the information
descriptors for the [code]#sycl::device# and [code]#sycl::context# classes.

[NOTE]
====
SYCL implementations are not required to support a memory order equivalent to
[code]#std::memory_order::consume#, and using this ordering within a SYCL device
kernel results in undefined behavior.
Developers are encouraged to use [code]#sycl::memory_order::acquire# instead.
====

[[sec:memory-scope]]
==== Memory scope

[source,,linenums]
----
include::{header_dir}/memoryScope.h[lines=4..-1]
----

The set of <<work-item,work-items>> and devices to which the memory ordering
constraints of a given atomic operation apply is controlled by a
[code]#sycl::memory_scope# parameter, which can take one of the following
values:

  * [code]#sycl::memory_scope::work_item# The ordering constraint applies only
    to the calling work-item;
  * [code]#sycl::memory_scope::sub_group# The ordering constraint applies only
    to work-items in the same <<sub-group>> as the calling work-item;
  * [code]#sycl::memory_scope::work_group# The ordering constraint applies only
    to work-items in the same <<work-group>> as the calling work-item;
  * [code]#sycl::memory_scope::device# The ordering constraint applies only to
    work-items executing on the same device as the calling work-item;
  * [code]#sycl::memory_scope::system# The ordering constraint applies to any
    work-item or host thread in the system that is currently permitted to access
    the memory allocation containing the referenced object, as defined by the
    capabilities of <<buffer,buffers>> and <<usm>>.

The memory scopes are listed above from narrowest
([code]#memory_scope::work_item#) to widest ([code]#memory_scope::system#).

The complete set of memory scopes is not guaranteed to be supported by every
device.
The set of supported memory scopes can be queried via the information
descriptors for the [code]#sycl::device# and [code]#sycl::context# classes.

The widest scope that can be applied to an atomic operation corresponds to the
set of work-items which can access the associated memory location.
For example, the widest scope that can be applied to atomic operations in
work-group local memory is [code]#sycl::memory_scope::work_group#.
If a wider scope is supplied, the behavior is as-if the narrowest scope
containing all work-items which can access the associated memory location was
supplied.

[NOTE]
====
The addition of memory scopes to the {cpp} memory model modifies the definition
of some concepts from the {cpp} core language.
For example: data races, the synchronizes-with relationship and sequential
consistency must be defined in a way that accounts for atomic operations with
differing (but compatible) scopes, in a manner similar to the <<opencl20, OpenCL
2.0 specification>>.
Efforts to formalize the memory model of SYCL are ongoing, and a formal memory
model will be included in a future version of the SYCL specification.
====

==== Atomic operations

Atomic operations can be performed on memory in buffers and USM.
The [code]#sycl::atomic_ref# class must be used to provide safe atomic access to
the buffer or USM allocation from device code.

==== Forward progress

This section, and any subsequent section referring to progress guarantees, uses
the following terms as defined in the {cpp} core language: thread of execution;
weakly parallel forward progress guarantees; parallel forward progress
guarantees; concurrent forward progress guarantees; and block with forward
progress guarantee delegation.

Each work-item in SYCL is a separate thread of execution, providing at least
weakly parallel forward progress guarantees.
Whether work-items provide stronger forward progress guarantees is
implementation-defined.

All implementations must additionally ensure that a work-item arriving at a
<<group-barrier, group barrier>> does not prevent other work-items in the same
group from making progress.
When a work-item arrives at a group barrier acting on group _G_, implementations
must eventually select and potentially strengthen another work-item in group _G_
that has not yet arrived at the barrier.

When a host thread blocks on the completion of a command previously submitted to
a SYCL queue (for example, via the [code]#sycl::queue::wait# function), it
blocks with forward progress guarantee delegation.

[NOTE]
====
SYCL commands submitted to a queue are not guaranteed to begin executing until a
host thread blocks on their completion.
In the absence of multiple host threads, there is no guarantee that host and
device code will execute concurrently.
====

// Later, this label will move onto a new subsection - see below
[[sec:progmodel.cpp]]
== The SYCL programming model

A SYCL program is written in standard {cpp}.
Host code and device code is written in the same {cpp} source file, enabling
instantiation of templated kernels from host code and also enabling kernel
source code to be shared between host and device.
The device kernels are encapsulated {cpp} callable types (a function object with
[code]#operator()# or a lambda function), which have been designated to be
compiled as SYCL kernels.

SYCL programs target heterogeneous systems.
The kernels may be compiled and optimized for multiple different processor
architectures with very different binary representations.


// TODO: Add \subsection{SYCL {cpp} language requirements} before merging
// Don't do until then to avoid changing section numbers
// [[sec:progmodel.cpp]]

[[sec:progmodel.minimumcppversion]]
=== Minimum version of {cpp}

The {cpp} features used in SYCL are based on a specific version of {cpp}.
Implementations of SYCL must support this minimum {cpp} version, which defines
the {cpp} constructs that can consequently be used by SYCL feature definitions
(for example, lambdas).

The minimum {cpp} version of this SYCL specification is determined by the
normative {cpp} core language defined in <<sec:normativerefs>>.
All implementations of this specification must support at least this core
language, and features within this specification are defined using features of
the core language.
Note that not all core language constructs are supported within
<<sycl-kernel-function,SYCL kernel functions>> or code invoked by a
<<sycl-kernel-function>>, as detailed by <<sec:language.restrictions.kernels>>.

Implementations may support newer {cpp} versions than the minimum required by
SYCL.
Code written using newer features than the SYCL requirement, though, may not be
portable to other implementations that don't support the same {cpp} version.


[[sec:progmodel.futurecppversion]]
=== Alignment with future versions of {cpp}

Some features of SYCL are aligned with the next {cpp} specification, as defined
in <<sec:normativerefs>>.

The following features are pre-adopted by SYCL 2020 and made available in the
[code]#sycl::# namespace: [code]#std::span#, [code]#std::dynamic_extent#,
[code]#std::bit_cast#.
The implementations of pre-adopted features are compliant with the next {cpp}
specification, and are expected to forward directly to standard {cpp} features
in a future version of SYCL.

The following features of SYCL 2020 use syntax based on the next {cpp}
specification: [code]#sycl::atomic_ref#.
These features behave as described in the next {cpp} specification, barring
modifications to ensure compatibility with other SYCL 2020 features and
heterogeneous programming.
Any such modifications are documented in the corresponding sections of this
specification.

=== Basic data parallel kernels

Data-parallel <<kernel,kernels>> that execute as multiple
<<work-item,work-items>> and where no work-group-local coordination is required
are enqueued with the [code]#sycl::parallel_for# function parameterized by a
[code]#sycl::range# parameter.
These kernels will execute the kernel function body once for each work-item in
the specified <<range>>.

Functionality tied to <<group, groups>> of work-items, including
<<group-barrier, group barriers>> and <<local-memory>>, must not be used within
these kernels.

Variables with <<reduction>> semantics can be added to basic data parallel
kernels using the features described in <<sec:reduction>>.

=== Work-group data parallel kernels

Data parallel <<kernel,kernels>> can also execute in a mode where the set of
<<work-item,work-items>> is divided into <<work-group,work-groups>> of
user-defined dimensions.
The user specifies the global <<range>> and local work-group size as parameters
to the [code]#sycl::parallel_for# function with a [code]#sycl::nd_range#
parameter.
In this mode of execution, kernels execute over the <<nd-range>> in work-groups
of the specified size.
It is possible to share data among work-items within the same work-group in
<<local-memory,local>> or <<global-memory>>, and the [code]#group_barrier#
function can be used to block a work-item until all work-items in the same
work-group arrive at the barrier.
All work-groups in a given [code]#parallel_for# will be the same size, and the
global size defined in the nd-range must either be a multiple of the work-group
size in each dimension, or the global size must be zero.
When the global size is zero, the kernel function is not executed, the local
size is ignored, and any dependencies are satisfied.

Work-groups may be further subdivided into <<sub-group,sub-groups>>.
The work-items that compose a sub-group are selected in an
implementation-defined way, and therefore the size and number of sub-groups may
differ for each kernel.
Moreover, different devices may make different guarantees with respect to how
sub-groups within a work-group are scheduled.
The maximum number of work-items in any sub-group in a kernel is based on a
combination of the kernel and its dispatch dimensions.
The size of any sub-group in the dispatch is between 1 and this maximum
sub-group size, and the size of an individual sub-group is invariant for the
duration of a kernel's execution.
Similarly to work-groups, the [code]#group_barrier# function can be used to
block a work-item until all work-items in the same sub-group arrive at the
barrier.

Portable device code must not assume that work-items within a sub-group execute
in any particular order, that work-groups are subdivided into sub-groups in a
specific way, nor that the work-items within a sub-group provide specific
forward progress guarantees.

Variables with <<reduction>> semantics can be added to work-group data parallel
kernels using the features described in <<sec:reduction>>.


=== Hierarchical data parallel kernels

[NOTE]
====
Based on developer and implementation feedback, the hierarchical data parallel
kernel feature described next is undergoing improvements to better align with
the frameworks and patterns prevalent in modern programming.
As this is a key part of the SYCL API and we expect to make changes to it, we
temporarily recommend that new codes refrain from using this feature until the
new API is finished in a near-future version of the SYCL specification, when
full use of the updated feature will be recommended for use in new code.
Existing codes using this feature will of course be supported by conformant
implementations of this specification.
====

The SYCL compiler provides a way of specifying data parallel kernels that
execute within work-groups via a different syntax which highlights the
hierarchical nature of the parallelism.
This mode is purely a compiler feature and does not change the execution model
of the kernel.
Instead of calling [code]#sycl::parallel_for# the user calls
[code]#sycl::parallel_for_work_group# with a [code]#sycl::range# value
representing the number of work-groups to launch and optionally a second
[code]#sycl::range# representing the size of each work-group for performance
tuning.
All code within the [code]#parallel_for_work_group# scope effectively executes
once per work-group.
Within the [code]#parallel_for_work_group# scope, it is possible to call
[code]#parallel_for_work_item# which creates a new scope in which all work-items
within the current work-group execute.
This enables a programmer to write code that looks like there is an inner
work-item loop inside an outer work-group loop, which closely matches the effect
of the execution model.
All variables declared inside the [code]#parallel_for_work_group# scope are
allocated in work-group local memory, whereas all variables declared inside the
[code]#parallel_for_work_item# scope are declared in private memory.
All [code]#parallel_for_work_item# calls within a given
[code]#parallel_for_work_group# execution must have the same dimensions.


=== Kernels that are not launched over parallel instances

Simple kernels for which only a single instance of the kernel function will be
executed are enqueued with the [code]#sycl::single_task# function.
The kernel enqueued takes no "`work-item id`" parameter and will only execute
once.
The behavior is logically equivalent to executing a kernel on a single compute
unit with a single work-group comprising only one work-item.
Such kernels may be enqueued on multiple queues and devices and as a result may
be executed in task-parallel fashion.


[[sec:pre-defined-kernels]]
=== Pre-defined kernels

Some <<backend, SYCL backends>> may expose pre-defined functionality to users as
kernels.
These kernels are not programmable, hence they are not bound by the SYCL {cpp}
programming model restrictions, and how they are written is
implementation-defined.


[[sec:coordination]]
=== Coordination and Synchronization

Coordination between the host and any devices can be expressed in the host SYCL
application using calls into the SYCL runtime.
Coordination between work-items executing inside of device code can be expressed
using group barriers.

Some function calls synchronize with other function calls performed by another
thread (potentially on another device).
Other functions are defined in terms of their synchronization operations.
Such functions can be used to ensure that the host and any devices do not access
data concurrently, and/or to reason about the ordering of operations across the
host and any devices.

==== Host-Device Coordination

The following operations can be used to coordinate host and device(s):

  * _Buffer destruction_: The destructors for [code]#sycl::buffer#,
    [code]#sycl::unsampled_image# and [code]#sycl::sampled_image# objects block
    until all submitted work on those objects completes and copy the data back
    to host memory before returning.
    These destructors only block if the object was constructed with attached
    host memory and if data needs to be copied back to the host.
+
--
More complex forms of buffer destruction can be specified by the user by
constructing buffers with other kinds of references to memory, such as
[code]#shared_ptr# and [code]#unique_ptr#.
--
  * _Host Accessors_: The constructor for a host accessor blocks until all
    kernels that modify the same buffer (or image) in any queues complete and
    then copies data back to host memory before the constructor returns.
    Any command groups with requirements to the same memory object cannot
    execute until the host accessor is destroyed as shown on <<fig:host-acc>>.
  * _Command group enqueue_: The <<sycl-runtime>> internally ensures that any
    command groups added to queues have the correct event dependencies added to
    those queues to ensure correct operation.
    Adding command groups to queues never blocks, and the [code]#sycl::event#
    returned by the queue's submit function contains event information related
    to the specific command group.
  * _Queue operations_: The user can manually use queue operations, such as
    [code]#sycl::queue::wait()# to block execution of the calling thread until
    all the command groups submitted to the queue have finished execution.
    Note that this will also affect the dependencies of those command groups in
    other queues.
  * _SYCL event objects_: SYCL provides [code]#sycl::event# objects which can be
    used to track and specify dependencies.
    The <<sycl-runtime>> must ensure that these objects can be used to enforce
    dependencies that span SYCL contexts from different <<backend, SYCL
    backends>>.

The specification for each of these blocking functions defines some set of
operations that cause the function to unblock.
These operations always happen before the blocking function returns (using the
definition of "happens before" from the C++ specification).

Note that the destructors of other SYCL objects ([code]#sycl::queue#,
[code]#sycl::context#,{ldots}) do not block.
Only a [code]#sycl::buffer#, [code]#sycl::sampled_image# or
[code]#sycl::unsampled_image# destructor might block.
The rationale is that an object without any side effect on the host does not
need to block on destruction as it would impact the performance.
So it is up to the programmer to use a member function to wait for completion in
some cases if this does not fit the goal.
See <<sec:managing-object-lifetimes>> for more information on object life time.

==== Work-item Coordination

A <<group-barrier>> provides a mechanism to coordinate all work-items in the
same group.
All work-items in a group must execute the barrier before any are allowed to
continue execution beyond the barrier.
Note that the group barrier must be encountered by all work-items of a group
executing the kernel or by none at all.
<<work-group-barrier>> and <<sub-group-barrier>> functionality is exposed via
the [code]#group_barrier# function.

Coordination between work-items in different work-groups must take place via
atomic operations, and is possible only on SYCL device with certain
capabilities, as described in <<sec:memoryconsistency>>.

=== Error handling

In SYCL, there are two types of errors: synchronous errors that can be detected
immediately when an API call is made, and <<async-error,asynchronous errors>>
that can only be detected later after an API call has returned.
Synchronous errors, such as failure to construct an object, are reported
immediately by the runtime throwing an exception.
<<async-error,Asynchronous errors>>, such as an error occurring during execution
of a kernel on a device, are reported via an asynchronous error-handler
mechanism.

<<async-error,Asynchronous errors>> are not reported immediately as they occur.
The asynchronous error handler for a context or queue is called with a
[code]#sycl::exception_list# object, which contains a list of
asynchronously-generated exception objects, on the conditions described by
<<subsubsec:exception.async>> and <<subsubsec:exception.nohandler>>.

Asynchronous errors may be generated regardless of whether the user has
specified any asynchronous error handler(s), as described in
<<subsubsec:exception.nohandler>>.

Some <<backend, SYCL backends>> can report errors that are specific to the
platform they are targeting, or that are more concrete than the errors provided
by the SYCL API.
Any error reported by a <<backend>> must derive from the base
[code]#sycl::exception#.
When a user wishes to capture specifically an error thrown by a <<backend>>, she
must include the <<backend>>-specific headers for said <<backend>>.

=== Fallback mechanism

A <<command-group-function-object>> can be submitted either to a single queue to
be executed on, or to a secondary queue.
If a <<command-group-function-object>> fails to be enqueued to the primary
queue, then the system will attempt to enqueue it to the secondary queue, if
given as a parameter to the submit function.
If the <<command-group-function-object>> fails to be queued to both of these
queues, then a synchronous SYCL exception will be thrown.

It is possible that a command group may be successfully enqueued, but then
asynchronously fail to run, for some reason.
In this case, it may be possible for the runtime system to execute the
<<command-group-function-object>> on the secondary queue, instead of the primary
queue.
The situations where a SYCL runtime may be able to achieve this asynchronous
fall-back is implementation-defined.

=== Scheduling of kernels and data movement

A <<command-group-function-object>> takes a reference to a command group
[code]#handler# as a parameter and anything within that scope is immediately
executed and takes the handler object as a parameter.
The intention is that a user will perform calls to SYCL functions, member
functions, destructors and constructors inside that scope.
These calls will be non-blocking on the host, but enqueue operations to the
queue that the command group is submitted to.
All user functions within the command group scope will be called on the host as
the <<command-group-function-object>> is executed, but any <<command, commands>>
it invokes will be added to the SYCL <<queue>>.
All commands added to the <<queue>> will be executed out-of-order from each
other, according to their data dependencies.


[[sec:managing-object-lifetimes]]
=== Managing object lifetimes

A SYCL application does not initialize any <<backend>> features until a
[code]#sycl::context# object is created.
A user does not need to explicitly create a [code]#sycl::context# object, but
they do need to explicitly create a [code]#sycl::queue# object, for which a
[code]#sycl::context# object will be implicitly created if not provided by the
user.

All <<backend>> objects encapsulated in SYCL objects are reference-counted and
will be destroyed once all references have been released.
This means that a user needs only create a SYCL <<queue>> (which will
automatically create an SYCL context) for the lifetime of their application to
initialize and release any <<backend>> objects safely.

There is no global state specified to be required in SYCL implementations.
This means, for example, that if the user creates two queues without explicitly
constructing a common context, then a SYCL implementation does not have to
create a shared context for the two queues.
Implementations are free to share or cache state globally for performance, but
it is not required.

Memory objects can be constructed with or without attached host memory.
If no host memory is attached at the point of construction, then destruction of
that memory object is non-blocking.
The user may use {cpp} standard pointer classes for sharing the host data with
the user application and for defining blocking, or non-blocking behavior of the
buffers and images.
If host memory is attached by using a raw pointer, then the default behavior is
followed, which is that the destructor will block until any command groups
operating on the memory object have completed, then, if the contents of the
memory object is modified on a device those contents are copied back to host and
only then does the destructor return.

In the case where host memory is shared between the user application and the
<<sycl-runtime>> with a [code]#std::shared_ptr#, then the reference counter of
the [code]#std::shared_ptr# determines whether the buffer needs to copy data
back on destruction, and in that case the blocking or non-blocking behavior
depends on the user application.

Instead of a [code]#std::shared_ptr#, a [code]#std::unique_ptr# may be provided,
which uses move semantics for initializing and using the associated host memory.
In this case, the behavior of the buffer in relation to the user application
will be non-blocking on destruction.

As said in <<sec:coordination>>, the only blocking operations in SYCL (apart
from explicit wait operations) are:

  * host accessor constructor, which waits for any kernels enqueued before its
    creation that write to the corresponding object to finish and be copied back
    to host memory before it starts processing.
    The host accessor does not necessarily copy back to the same host memory as
    initially given by the user;
  * memory object destruction, in the case where copies back to host memory have
    to be done or when the host memory is used as a backing-store.


=== Device discovery and selection

A user specifies which queue to submit a <<command-group-function-object>> and
each <<queue>> is targeted to run on a specific <<device>> (and <<context>>).
A user can specify the actual device on queue creation, or they can specify a
<<device-selector>> which causes the <<sycl-runtime>> to choose a device based
on the user's provided preferences.
Specifying a <<device-selector>> causes the <<sycl-runtime>> to perform device
discovery.
No device discovery is performed until a SYCL <<device-selector>> is passed to a
queue constructor.
Device topology may be cached by the <<sycl-runtime>>, but this is not required.

Device discovery will return all <<device,devices>> from all
<<platform,platforms>> exposed by all the supported <<backend, SYCL backends>>.

=== Interfacing with the SYCL backend API

There are two styles of developing a SYCL application:

. writing a pure SYCL generic application;
. writing a SYCL application that relies on some <<backend>> specific behavior.

When users follow 1., there is no assumption about what <<backend>> will be used
during compilation or execution of the SYCL application.
Therefore, the <<backend-api>> is not assumed to be available to the developer.
Only standard {cpp} types and interfaces are assumed to be available, as
described in <<sec:progmodel.cpp>>.
Users only need to include the [code]#<sycl/sycl.hpp># header to write a SYCL
generic application.

On the other hand, when users follow 2., they must know what <<backend-api>>s
they are using.
In this case, any header required for the normal programmability of the
<<backend-api>> is assumed to be available to the user.
In addition to the [code]#<sycl/sycl.hpp># header, users must also include the
<<backend>>-specific header as defined in <<sec:headers-and-namespaces>>.
The <<backend>>-specific header provides the interoperability interface for the
SYCL API to interact with <<native-backend-object,native backend objects>>.

The interoperability API is defined in <<sec:backend-interoperability>>.

== Memory objects

SYCL memory objects represent data that is handled by the <<sycl-runtime>> and
can represent allocations in one or multiple <<device,devices>> at any time.
Memory objects, both buffers and images, may have one or more underlying
<<native-backend-object,native backend objects>> to ensure that <<queue,queues>>
objects can use data in any device.
A SYCL implementation may have multiple <<native-backend-object,native backend
objects>> for the same device.
The <<sycl-runtime>> is responsible for ensuring the different copies are
up-to-date whenever necessary, using whatever mechanism is available in the
system to update the copies of the underlying <<native-backend-object,native
backend objects>>.

[NOTE]
.Implementation note
====
A valid mechanism for this update is to transfer the data from one <<backend>>
into the system memory using the <<backend>>-specific mechanism available, and
then transfer it to a different device using the mechanism exposed by the new
<<backend>>.
====

Memory objects in SYCL fall into one of two categories: <<buffer>> objects and
<<image>> objects.
A buffer object stores a one-, two- or three-dimensional collection of elements
that are stored linearly directly back to back in the same way C or {cpp} stores
arrays.
An image object is used to store a one-, two- or three-dimensional texture,
frame-buffer or image data that may be stored in an optimized and
device-specific format in memory and must be accessed through specialized
operations.

Elements of a buffer object can be a scalar data type (such as an [code]#int# or
[code]#float#), vector data type, or a user-defined structure.
In SYCL, a <<buffer>> object is a templated type ([code]#sycl::buffer#),
parameterized by the element type and number of dimensions.
An <<image>> object is stored in one of a limited number of formats.
The elements of an image object are selected from a list of predefined image
formats which are provided by an underlying <<backend>> implementation.
Images are encapsulated in the [code]#sycl::unsampled_image# or
[code]#sycl::sampled_image# types, which are templated by the number of
dimensions in the image.
The minimum number of elements in an image object is one.
The minimum number of elements in a buffer object is zero.

The fundamental differences between a buffer and an image object are:

  * elements in a buffer are stored in an array of 1, 2 or 3 dimensions and can
    be accessed using an accessor by a kernel executing on a device.
    The accessors for kernels provide a member function to get {cpp} pointer
    types, or the [code]#sycl::global_ptr# class;
  * elements of an image are stored in a format that is opaque to the user and
    cannot be directly accessed using a pointer.
    SYCL provides image accessors and samplers to allow a kernel to read from or
    write to an image;
  * for a buffer object the data is accessed within a kernel in the same format
    as it is stored in memory, but in the case of an image object the data is
    not necessarily accessed within a kernel in the same format as it is stored
    in memory;
  * image elements are always a 4-component vector (each component can be a
    float or signed/unsigned integer) in a kernel.
    Accessors that read an image convert image elements from their storage
    format into a 4-component vector.
+
--
Similarly, the SYCL accessor member functions provided to write to an image
convert the image element from a 4-component vector to the appropriate image
format specified such as four 8-bit elements, for example.
--

Users may want fine-grained control of the memory management and storage
semantics of SYCL image or buffer objects.
For example, a user may wish to specify the host memory for a memory object to
use, but may not want the memory object to block on destruction.

Depending on the control and the use cases of the SYCL applications, well
established {cpp} classes and patterns can be used for reference counting and
sharing data between user applications and the <<sycl-runtime>>.
For control over memory allocation on the host and mapping between host and
device memory, pre-defined or user-defined {cpp} [code]#std::allocator# classes
are used.
To avoid data races when sharing data between SYCL and non-SYCL applications,
[code]#std::shared_ptr# and [code]#std::mutex# classes are used.


== Multi-dimensional objects and linearization

SYCL defines a number of multi-dimensional objects such as buffers and
accessors.
The iteration space of work-items in a kernel may also be multi-dimensional.
The size of each dimension is defined by a [code]#range# object of one, two or
three dimensions, and an element in the multi-dimensional space can be
identified using an [code]#id# object with the same number of dimensions as the
corresponding [code]#range#.

If the size of any dimension is zero, there are zero elements in the
multi-dimensional range.

[[sec:multi-dim-linearization]]
=== Linearization

Some multi-dimensional objects can be viewed in a linear form.
When this happens, the right-most term in the object's range varies fastest in
the linearization.

A three-dimensional element [code]#id{id0, id1, id2}# within a three-dimensional
object of range [code]#range{r0, r1, r2}# has a linear position defined by:
[latexmath]
++++
id2 + (id1 \cdot r2) + (id0 \cdot r1 \cdot r2)
++++

A two-dimensional element [code]#id{id0, id1}# within a two-dimensional
[code]#range{r0, r1}# follows a similar equation:
[latexmath]
++++
id1 + (id0 \cdot r1)
++++

A one-dimensional element [code]#id{id0}# within a one-dimensional range
[code]#range{r0}# is equivalent to its linear form.


[[sec:multi-dim-subscript]]
=== Multi-dimensional subscript operators

Some multi-dimensional objects can be indexed using the subscript operator where
consecutive subscript operators correspond to each dimension.
The right-most operator varies fastest, as with standard {cpp} arrays.
Formally, a three-dimensional subscript access [code]#a[id0][id1][id2]#
references the element at [code]#id{id0, id1, id2}#.
A two-dimensional subscript access [code]#a[id0][id1]# references the element at
[code]#id{id0, id1}#.
A one-dimensional subscript access [code]#a[id0]# references the element at
[code]#id{id0}#.


== Implementation options

The SYCL language is designed to allow several different possible
implementations.
The contents of this section are non-normative, so implementations need not
follow the guidelines listed here.
However, this section is intended to help readers understand the possible
strategies that can be used to implement SYCL.

[[subsec:smcp]]
=== Single source multiple compiler passes

With this technique, known as <<smcp>>, there are separate host and device
compilers.
Each SYCL source file is compiled two times: once by the host compiler and once
by the device compiler.
An implementation could support more than one device compiler, in which case
each SYCL source file is compiled more than two times.
The host compiler in this technique could be an off-the-shelf compiler with no
special knowledge of SYCL, but the device compiler must be SYCL aware.
The device compiler parses the source file to identify each
<<sycl-kernel-function>> and any <<device-function, device functions>> it calls.
SYCL is designed so that this analysis can be done statically.
The device compiler then generates code only for the <<sycl-kernel-function,
SYCL kernel functions>> and the <<device-function, device functions>>.

Typically, the device compilers generate header files which interface between
the host compiler and the <<sycl-runtime>>.
Therefore, the device compiler runs first, and then the host compiler consumes
these header files when generating the host code.

The device compilers in this technique generate one or more <<device-image,
device images>> for the <<sycl-kernel-function, SYCL kernel functions>>, which
can be read by the <<sycl-runtime>>.
Each <<device-image>> could either contain native ISA for a device or it could
contain an intermediate language such as SPIR-V.
In the later case, the <<sycl-runtime>> must translate the intermediate language
into native device ISA when the <<sycl-kernel-function>> is submitted to a
device.

Since this technique has separate host and device compilers, there needs to be
some way to associate a <<sycl-kernel-function>> (which is compiled by the
device compiler) with the code that invokes it (which is compiled by the host
compiler).
Implementations conformant to the reduced feature set
(<<sec:feature-sets.reduced>>) can do this by using the {cpp} type of the
<<sycl-kernel-function>>.
This type is specified via the <<kernel-name>> template parameter if the
<<sycl-kernel-function>> is a lambda function, or it is obtained from the class
type if the <<sycl-kernel-function>> is an object.
Implementations conformant to the full feature set (<<sec:feature-sets.full>>)
do not require a <<kernel-name>> at the invocation site, so they must implement
some other way to make the association.


[[subsec:sscp]]
=== Single source single compiler pass

With this technique, known as <<sscp>>, the vendor implements a custom compiler
that reads each SYCL source file only once, and that compiler generates the host
code as well as the <<device-image, device images>> for the
<<sycl-kernel-function, SYCL kernel functions>>.
As in the <<smcp>> case, each <<device-image>> could either contain native
device ISA or an intermediate language.

=== Library-only implementation

It is also possible to implement SYCL purely as a library, using an
off-the-shelf host compiler with no special support for SYCL.
In such an implementation, each <<kernel>> may run on the host system.


== Language restrictions in kernels

The SYCL <<kernel,kernels>> are executed on SYCL devices and all of the
functions called from a SYCL kernel are going to be compiled for the device by a
SYCL <<device-compiler>>.
Due to restrictions of the heterogeneous devices where the SYCL kernel will
execute, there are certain restrictions on the base {cpp} language features that
can be used inside kernel code.
For details on language restrictions please refer to
<<sec:language.restrictions.kernels>>.

SYCL kernels use arguments that are captured by value in the
<<command-group-scope>> or are passed from the host to the device using
<<accessor,accessors>>.
Sharing data structures between host and device code imposes certain
restrictions, such as using only objects that are <<device-copyable>>, and in
general, no pointers initialized for the host can be used on the device.
SYCL memory objects, such as [code]#sycl::buffer#,
[code]#sycl::unsampled_image#, and [code]#sycl::sampled_image#, cannot be passed
to a kernel.
Instead, a kernel must interact with these objects through
<<accessor,accessors>>.
No hierarchical structures of these memory object classes are supported and any
other data containers need to be converted to the SYCL data management classes
using the SYCL interface.
For more details on the rules for kernel parameter passing, please refer to
<<sec:kernel.parameter.passing>>.

Pointers to <<usm>> allocations may be passed to a kernel either directly as
arguments or indirectly inside of other objects.
Pointers to <<usm>> allocations that are passed as kernel arguments are treated
as being in the global address space.

[[sec::device.copyable]]
=== Device copyable

The SYCL implementation may need to copy data between the host and a device or
between two devices.
For example, this may occur when a <<command-group>> has a requirement for the
contents of a buffer or when the application passes certain arguments to a
<<sycl-kernel-function>> (as described in <<sec:kernel.parameter.passing>>).
Such data must have a type that is <<device-copyable>> as defined below.

Any type that is trivially copyable (as defined by the {cpp} core language) is
implicitly device copyable.

Although implementations are not required to support device code that calls
library functions from the {cpp} core language, some implementations may provide
device support for some of these functions.
If the implementation provides device support for one of the following classes,
that type is also implicitly device copyable:

  * [code]#std::array<T, 0>#;
  * [code]#std::array<T, N># if [code]#T# is device copyable;
  * [code]#std::optional<T># if [code]#T# is device copyable;
  * [code]#std::pair<T1, T2># if [code]#T1# and [code]#T2# are device copyable;
  * [code]#std::tuple<>#;
  * [code]#+std::tuple<Types...>+# if all the types in the parameter pack
    [code]#Types# are device copyable;
  * [code]#std::variant<>#;
  * [code]#+std::variant<Types...>+# if all the types in the parameter pack
    [code]#Types# are device copyable;
  * [code]#std::basic_string_view<CharT, Traits>#;
  * [code]#std::span<ElementType, Extent># (the [code]#std::span# type has been
    introduced in {cpp}20);
  * [code]#sycl::span<ElementType, Extent>#.

If the implementation provides device support for one of the classes listed
above, arrays of that class and cv-qualified versions of that class are also
device copyable.

[NOTE]
====
The types [code]#std::basic_string_view<CharT, Traits># and
[code]#std::span<ElementType, Extent># are both view types, which reference
underlying data that is not contained within their type.
Although these view types are device copyable, the implementation copies just
the view and not the contained data when doing an inter-device copy.
In order to reference the contained data after such a copy, the application must
allocate the contained data in unified shared memory (USM) that is accessible on
both the host and device (or on both devices in the case of a device-to-device
copy).
====

In addition, the implementation may allow the application to explicitly declare
certain class types as device copyable.
If the implementation has this support, it must predefine the preprocessor macro
[code]#SYCL_DEVICE_COPYABLE# to [code]#1#, and it must not predefine this
preprocessor macro if it does not have this support.
When the implementation has this support, a class type [code]#T# is device
copyable if all of the following statements are true:

  * The application defines the trait [code]#is_device_copyable_v<T># to
    [code]#true#;
  * Type [code]#T# has at least one eligible copy constructor, move constructor,
    copy assignment operator, or move assignment operator;
  * Each eligible copy constructor, move constructor, copy assignment operator,
    and move assignment operator is [code]#public#;
  * When doing an inter-device transfer of an object of type [code]#T#, the
    effect of each eligible copy constructor, move constructor, copy assignment
    operator, and move assignment operator is the same as a bitwise copy of the
    object;
  * Type [code]#T# has a [code]#public# non-deleted destructor;
  * The destructor has no effect when executed on the device.

When the application explicitly declares a class type to be device copyable,
arrays of that type and cv-qualified versions of that type are also device
copyable, and the implementation sets the [code]#is_device_copyable_v# trait to
[code]#true# for these array and cv-qualified types.

[NOTE]
====
It is unspecified whether the implementation actually calls the copy
constructor, move constructor, copy assignment operator, or move assignment
operator of a class declared as [code]#is_device_copyable_v# when doing an
inter-device copy.
Since these operations must all be the same as a bitwise copy, the
implementation may simply copy the memory where the object resides.
Likewise, it is unspecified whether the implementation actually calls the
destructor for such a class on the device since the destructor must have no
effect on the device.

== Endianness support

SYCL does not mandate any particular byte order, but the byte order of the host
always matches the byte order of the devices.
This allows data to be copied between the host and the devices without any byte
swapping.

== Example SYCL application

Below is a more complex example application, combining some of the features
described above.
