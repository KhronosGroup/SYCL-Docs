This Specification has been created under the Khronos Intellectual Property
Rights Policy, which is Attachment A of the Khronos Group Membership Agreement
available at https://www.khronos.org/files/member_agreement.pdf.
Parties desiring to implement the Specification and make use of Khronos

license protection under the Khronos Intellectual Property Rights Policy must
become Adopters and confirm the implementation as conformant under the process
defined by Khronos for this Specification; see https://www.khronos.org/adopters.

The Khronos Intellectual Property Rights Policy defines the terms 'Scope',
'Compliant Portion', and 'Necessary Patent Claims'.

Some parts of this Specification are purely informative and so are EXCLUDED from
the Scope of this Specification.
<<sec:nonnormativerefs>> defines how these parts of the Specification are
identified.

Where this Specification uses technical terminology, defined in the Glossary or
otherwise, that refer to enabling technologies that are not expressly set forth
in this Specification, those enabling technologies are EXCLUDED from the Scope
of this Specification.
For clarity, enabling technologies not disclosed with particularity in this
Specification (e.g. semiconductor manufacturing technology, hardware
architecture, processor architecture or microarchitecture, memory architecture,
compiler technology, object oriented technology, basic operating system
technology, compression technology, algorithms, and so on) are NOT to be
considered expressly set forth; only those application program interfaces and
data structures disclosed with particularity are included in the Scope of this
Specification.

For purposes of the Khronos Intellectual Property Rights Policy as it relates to
the definition of Necessary Patent Claims, all recommended or optional features,
behaviors and functionality set forth in this Specification, if implemented, are
considered to be included as Compliant Portions.

Where this Specification identifies specific sections of external references,
only those specifically identified sections define normative functionality.
The Khronos Intellectual Property Rights Policy excludes external references to
materials and associated enabling technology not created by Khronos from the
Scope of this Specification, and any licenses that may be required to implement
such referenced materials and associated technologies must be obtained
separately and may involve royalty payments.
