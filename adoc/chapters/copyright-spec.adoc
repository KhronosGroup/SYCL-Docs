This Specification has been created under the Khronos Intellectual Property
Rights Policy, which is Attachment A of the Khronos Group Membership Agreement
available at https://www.khronos.org/files/member_agreement.pdf, and which
defines the terms 'Scope', 'Compliant Portion', and 'Necessary Patent Claims'.

defined by Khronos for this Specification; see https://www.khronos.org/adopters.

Some parts of this Specification are purely informative and so are EXCLUDED from
the Scope of this Specification.
// Jon: how much do we want to say about Informative spec sections? No
// convention in use at present. Could also add a "technical terminology"
// section and link from the following paragraph.
// The <<introduction-conventions>> section of the
// <<introduction>> defines how these parts of the Specification are identified.

Where this Specification uses technical terminology, defined in the <<glossary>>
or otherwise, that refer to enabling technologies that are not expressly set
forth in this Specification, those enabling technologies are EXCLUDED from the
Scope of this Specification.
For clarity, enabling technologies not disclosed with particularity in this
Specification (e.g. semiconductor manufacturing technology, hardware
architecture, processor architecture or microarchitecture, memory architecture,
compiler technology, object oriented technology, basic operating system
technology, compression technology, algorithms, and so on) are NOT to be
considered expressly set forth; only those application program interfaces and
data structures disclosed with particularity are included in the Scope of this
Specification.

For purposes of the Khronos Intellectual Property Rights Policy as it relates to
the definition of Necessary Patent Claims, all recommended or optional features,
behaviors and functionality set forth in this Specification, if implemented, are
considered to be included as Compliant Portions.

Where this Specification includes normative references to external documents,
only the specifically identified sections of those external documents are
INCLUDED in the Scope of this Specification.
If not created by Khronos, those external documents may contain contributions
from non-members of Khronos not covered by the Khronos Intellectual Property
Rights Policy.
