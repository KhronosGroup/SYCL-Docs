[[chapter:sycl-programming-interface]]
= SYCL programming interface

The SYCL programming interface provides a common abstracted feature set to
one or more <<backend>> APIs. This section describes the {cpp} library
interface to the <<sycl-runtime>> which executes across those <<backend, SYCL backends>>.

The entirety of the SYCL interface defined in this section is required to be
available for any <<backend, SYCL backends>>, with the exception of the interoperability
interface, which is described in general terms in this document, not
pertaining to any particular <<backend>>.

SYCL guarantees that all the member functions and special member functions of
the SYCL classes described are thread safe.


[[sec:backends]]
== Backends

The <<backend, SYCL backends>> that are available to a SYCL implementation can be identified
using the [code]#enum class backend#.

[source,,linenums]
----
include::{header_dir}/backends.h[lines=4..-1]
----

The [code]#enum class backend# is implementation-defined and must be
populated with a unique identifier for each <<backend>> that the SYCL
implementation supports.

Each named <<backend>> enumerated in the [code]#enum class backend#
must be associated with a <<backend>> specification.
Many sections of this specification
will refer to the associated <<backend>> specification.


[[sec:backend-macros]]
=== Backend macros

As the identifiers defined in [code]#enum class backend# are
implementation-defined,
a SYCL implementation must also define a preprocessor macro for each of
these identifiers.  If the <<backend>> is defined by the Khronos SYCL group, the
name of the macro has the form [code]#SYCL_BACKEND_<backend_name>#, where
_backend_name_ is the associated identifier from [code]#backend# in
all upper-case.  See <<chapter.extensions>> for the name of the macro
if the vendor defines the <<backend>> outside of the Khronos SYCL group.


[[sec:generic-vs-non-generic]]
== Generic vs non-generic SYCL

The SYCL programming API is split into two categories; generic SYCL and
non-generic SYCL. Almost everything in the SYCL programming API is considered
generic SYCL. However any usage of the [code]#enum class backend# is
considered non-generic SYCL and should only be used for <<backend>> specialized
code paths, as the identifiers defined in [code]#backend# are
implementation-defined.

In any non-generic SYCL application code where the [code]#backend# enum
class is used, the expression must be guarded with a preprocessor
[code]#{hash}ifdef# guard using the associated preprocessor macro to ensure that
the SYCL application will compile even if the SYCL implementation does not
support that <<backend>> being specialized for.


[[sec:headers-and-namespaces]]
== Header files and namespaces

SYCL provides one standard header file: [code]#<sycl/sycl.hpp>#, which needs to
be included in every translation unit that uses the SYCL programming API.

All SYCL classes, constants, types and functions defined by this
specification should exist within the [code]#::sycl# namespace.

For compatibility with SYCL 1.2.1, SYCL provides another standard
header file: [code]#<CL/sycl.hpp>#, which can be included in
place of [code]#<sycl/sycl.hpp>#.  In that case, all SYCL classes, constants,
types and functions defined by this specification should exist within the
[code]#::cl::sycl# {cpp} namespace.

For consistency, the programming API will only refer to the
[code]#<sycl/sycl.hpp># header and the [code]#::sycl# namespace, but this
should be considered synonymous with the SYCL 1.2.1 header and namespace.

Include paths starting with [code]#"sycl/ext/"# and [code]#"sycl/backend/"# are
reserved for extensions to SYCL and for backend interop headers respectively.
Other include paths starting with [code]#"sycl/"# and the [code]#sycl::detail#
namespace are reserved for implementation details.

When a <<backend>> is defined by the Khronos SYCL group, functionality
for that <<backend>> is available via the header
[code]#"sycl/backend/<backend_name>.hpp"#, and all <<backend>>-specific
functionality is made available in the namespace [code]#sycl::<backend_name>#
where [code]#<backend_name># is the name of the <<backend>> as defined in the
<<backend>> specification.

<<chapter.extensions>> defines the allowable header files and
namespaces for any extensions that a vendor may provide, including any
<<backend>> that the vendor may define outside of the Khronos SYCL group.

== Class availability

In SYCL some <<sycl-runtime>> classes are available to the SYCL application,
some are available within a <<sycl-kernel-function>> and some are available
on both and can be passed as arguments to a <<sycl-kernel-function>>.

Each of the following <<sycl-runtime>> classes:
[code]#buffer#,
[code]#buffer_allocator#,
[code]#context#,
[code]#device#,
[code]#device_image#,
[code]#event#,
[code]#exception#,
[code]#handler#,
[code]#host_accessor#,
[code]#host_sampled_image_accessor#,
[code]#host_unsampled_image_accessor#,
[code]#id#,
[code]#image_allocator#,
[code]#kernel#,
[code]#kernel_id#,
[code]#marray#,
[code]#kernel_bundle#,
[code]#nd_range#,
[code]#platform#,
[code]#queue#,
[code]#range#,
[code]#sampled_image#,
[code]#image_sampler#,
[code]#stream#,
[code]#unsampled_image# and
[code]#vec#
must be available to the host application.

Each of the following <<sycl-runtime>> classes:
[code]#accessor#,
[code]#atomic_ref#,
[code]#device_event#,
[code]#group#,
[code]#h_item#,
[code]#id#,
[code]#item#,
[code]#local_accessor#,
[code]#marray#,
[code]#multi_ptr#,
[code]#nd_item#,
[code]#range#,
[code]#reducer#,
[code]#sampled_image_accessor#,
[code]#stream#,
[code]#sub_group#,
[code]#unsampled_image_accessor# and
[code]#vec#
must be available within a <<sycl-kernel-function>>.

== Common interface

When a dimension template parameter is used in SYCL classes, it is
defaulted as 1 in most cases.


[[sec:backend-interoperability]]
=== Backend interoperability

Many of the <<sycl-runtime>> classes may be implemented such that they
encapsulate an object unique to the <<backend>> that underpins the
functionality of that class. Where appropriate, these classes may provide an
interface for interoperating between the <<sycl-runtime>> object and the
<<native-backend-object>> in order to support interoperability within an
application between SYCL and the associated <<backend-api>>.

There are two forms of interoperability with <<sycl-runtime>> classes:
interoperability on the <<sycl-application>> with the <<backend-api>>
and interoperability within a <<sycl-kernel-function>> with the equivalent
kernel language types of the <<backend>>. <<sycl-application,SYCL application>>
interoperability and <<sycl-kernel-function>> interoperability are
provided via different interfaces and may have different
<<native-backend-object>> types.

<<sycl-application,SYCL application>> interoperability may be provided for
[code]#buffer#,
[code]#context#,
[code]#device#,
[code]#device_image#,
[code]#event#,
[code]#kernel#,
[code]#kernel_bundle#,
[code]#platform#,
[code]#queue#,
[code]#sampled_image#, and
[code]#unsampled_image#.

<<sycl-kernel-function,SYCL kernel function>> interoperability may be provided for
[code]#accessor#,
[code]#device_event#,
[code]#local_accessor#,
[code]#sampled_image_accessor#,
[code]#stream# and
[code]#unsampled_image_accessor#
inside <<kernel-scope>> only and is not available outside of that scope.

Support for <<backend>> interoperability is optional and therefore not required
to be provided by a SYCL implementation. A SYCL application using <<backend>>
interoperability is considered to be non-generic SYCL.

Details on the interoperability for a given <<backend>> are available on the
<<backend>> specification document for that <<backend>>.

==== Type traits [code]#backend_traits#

[source,,linenums]
----
include::{header_dir}/interop/typeTraitsBackendTraits.h[lines=4..-1]
----

A series of type traits are provided for <<backend>> interoperability,
defined in the [code]#backend_traits# class.

A specialization of [code]#backend_traits# must be provided for each named
<<backend>> enumerated in the enum class [code]#backend#.

  * For each <<sycl-runtime>> class [code]#T# which supports
    <<sycl-application>> interoperability with the <<backend>>, a
    specialization of [code]#input_type# must be defined as the type
    of <<sycl-application>> interoperability <<native-backend-object>>
    associated with [code]#T# for the <<backend>>, specified in the
    <<backend>> specification.
    [code]#input_type# is used when constructing SYCL objects
    from backend specific native objects.
    See the relevant backend specification for details.
  * For each <<sycl-runtime>> class [code]#T# which supports
    <<sycl-application>> interoperability with the <<backend>>, a
    specialization of [code]#return_type# must be defined as the type
    of <<sycl-application>> interoperability <<native-backend-object>>
    associated with [code]#T# for the <<backend>>, specified in the
    <<backend>> specification.
    [code]#return_type# is used when retrieving
    the backend specific native object from a SYCL object.
    See the relevant backend specification for details.
  * For each <<sycl-runtime>> class [code]#T# which supports kernel
    function interoperability with the <<backend>>, a specialization of
    [code]#return_type# within [code]#backend_traits# must be
    defined as the type of the kernel function interoperability
    <<native-backend-object>> associated with [code]#T# for the
    <<backend>>, specified in the backend specification.
    See the relevant backend specification for details.
  * A specialization of [code]#errc# must be defined as the
    <<backend>> error code type.

The type alias [code]#backend_input_t# is provided
to enable less verbose access to the [code]#input_type# type
within [code]#backend_traits# for a specific SYCL object of type [code]#T#.
The type alias [code]#backend_return_t# is provided
to enable less verbose access to the [code]#return_type# type
within [code]#backend_traits# for a specific SYCL object of type [code]#T#.

==== Template function [code]#get_native#

[source,,linenums]
----
include::{header_dir}/interop/templateFunctionGetNative.h[lines=4..-1]
----

For each <<sycl-runtime>> class [code]#T# which supports
<<sycl-application>> interoperability, a specialization of
[code]#get_native# must be defined, which takes an instance of
[code]#T# and returns a <<sycl-application>> interoperability
<<native-backend-object>> associated with [code]#syclObject# which
can be used for <<sycl-application>> interoperability. The lifetime of the
object returned are backend-defined and specified in the backend
specification.

For each <<sycl-runtime>> class [code]#T# which supports kernel
function interoperability, a specialization of [code]#get_native# must
be defined, which takes an instance of [code]#T# and returns the kernel
function interoperability <<native-backend-object>> associated with
[code]#syclObject# which can be used for kernel function
interoperability. The availability and behavior of these template
functions is defined by the <<backend>> specification document.

The [code]#get_native# function
must throw an [code]#exception# with the
[code]#errc::backend_mismatch# error code
if the backend of the SYCL object
doesn't match the target backend.

[[sec:backend-interoperability-make]]
==== Template functions [code]#make_*#

[source,,linenums]
----
include::{header_dir}/interop/templateFunctionMakeX.h[lines=4..-1]
----

For each <<sycl-runtime>> class [code]#T# which supports
<<sycl-application>> interoperability, a specialization of the appropriate
template function [code]#make_{sycl_class}# where
[code]#{sycl_class}# is the class name of [code]#T#, must be
defined, which takes a <<sycl-application>> interoperability
<<native-backend-object>> and constructs and returns an instance of
[code]#T#. The availability and behavior of these template
functions is defined by the <<backend>> specification document.

Overloads of the [code]#make_{sycl_class}# function
which take a SYCL <<context>> object as an argument
must throw an [code]#exception# with the
[code]#errc::backend_mismatch# error code
if the backend of the provided SYCL context
doesn't match the target backend.

[[sec:reference-semantics]]
=== Common reference semantics

Each of the following <<sycl-runtime>> classes:
[code]#accessor#,
[code]#buffer#,
[code]#context#,
[code]#device#,
[code]#device_image#,
[code]#event#,
[code]#host_accessor#,
[code]#host_sampled_image_accessor#,
[code]#host_unsampled_image_accessor#,
[code]#kernel#,
[code]#kernel_id#,
[code]#kernel_bundle#,
[code]#local_accessor#,
[code]#platform#,
[code]#queue#,
[code]#sampled_image#,
[code]#sampled_image_accessor#,
[code]#unsampled_image# and
[code]#unsampled_image_accessor#
must obey the following statements, where [code]#T# is the runtime class type:

  * [code]#T# must be copy constructible and copy assignable on the
    host application and within SYCL kernel functions in the case that
    [code]#T# is a valid kernel argument. Any instance of
    [code]#T# that is constructed as a copy of another instance, via
    either the copy constructor or copy assignment operator, must behave
    as-if it were the original instance and as-if any action performed on it
    were also performed on the original instance and must represent the same
    underlying <<native-backend-object>> as the original instance where
    applicable.
  * [code]#T# must be destructible on the host application and within
    SYCL kernel functions in the case that [code]#T# is a valid kernel
    argument. When any instance of [code]#T# is destroyed, including as
    a result of the copy assignment operator, any behavior specific to
    [code]#T# that is specified as performed on destruction is only
    performed if this instance is the last remaining host copy, in
    accordance with the above definition of a copy.
  * [code]#T# must be move constructible and move assignable on the
    host application and within SYCL kernel functions in the case that T is
    a valid kernel argument. Any instance of T that is constructed as a move
    of another instance, via either the move constructor or move assignment
    operator, must replace the original instance rendering said instance
    invalid and must represent the same underlying <<native-backend-object>> as
    the original instance where applicable.
  * [code]#T# must be equality comparable on the host application.
    Equality between two instances of [code]#T# (i.e. [code]#a == b#) must be true if one instance is a copy of the other and non-equality
    between two instances of [code]#T# (i.e. [code]#a != b#) must
    be true if neither instance is a copy of the other, in accordance with
    the above definition of a copy, unless either instance has become
    invalidated by a move operation. By extension of the requirements above,
    equality on [code]#T# must guarantee to be reflexive (i.e. [code]#a == a#),
    symmetric (i.e. [code]#a == b# implies [code]#b == a# and [code]#a != b#
    implies [code]#b != a#) and transitive (i.e. [code]#a == b && b == c#
    implies [code]#c == a#).
  * A specialization of [code]#std::hash# for [code]#T# must exist
    on the host application that returns a unique value such that if two
    instances of T are equal, in accordance with the above definition, then
    their resulting hash values are also equal and subsequently if two hash
    values are not equal, then their corresponding instances are also not
    equal, in accordance with the above definition.

Some <<sycl-runtime>> classes will have additional behavior associated
with copy, movement, assignment or destruction semantics. If these are
specified they are in addition to those specified above unless stated
otherwise.

Each of the runtime classes mentioned above must provide a common
interface of special member functions in order to fulfill the copy,
move, destruction requirements and hidden friend functions in order to
fulfill the equality requirements.

A hidden friend function is a function first declared via a
[code]#friend# declaration with no additional out of class or namespace
scope declarations. Hidden friend functions are only visible to ADL
(Argument Dependent Lookup) and are hidden from qualified and unqualified
lookup. Hidden friend functions have the benefits of avoiding accidental
implicit conversions and faster compilation.

These common special member functions and hidden friend functions are
described in <<table.specialmembers.common.reference>> and
<<table.hiddenfriends.common.reference>> respectively.

[[sec:byval-semantics]]
=== Common by-value semantics

Each of the following <<sycl-runtime>> classes: [code]#id#,
[code]#range#, [code]#item#, [code]#nd_item#,
[code]#h_item#, [code]#group#, [code]#sub_group# and
[code]#nd_range# must follow the following statements, where
[code]#T# is the runtime class type:

  * [code]#T# must be default copy constructible and copy assignable on
    the host application (in the case where T is available on the host) and
    within SYCL kernel functions.
  * [code]#T# must be default destructible on the host application (in
    the case where T is available on the host) and within SYCL kernel
    functions.
  * [code]#T# must be default move constructible and default move
    assignable on the host application (in the case where T is available on
    the host) and within SYCL kernel functions.
  * [code]#T# must be equality comparable on the host application (in
    the case where T is available on the host) and within SYCL kernel
    functions. Equality between two instances of [code]#T# (i.e.
    [code]#a == b#) must be true if the value of all members are equal
    and non-equality between two instances of [code]#T# (i.e.
    [code]#a != b#) must be true if the value of any members are not
    equal, unless either instance has become invalidated by a move
    operation. By extension of the requirements above, equality on
    [code]#T# must guarantee to be reflexive (i.e. [code]#a == a#),
    symmetric (i.e. [code]#a == b# implies [code]#b == a# and [code]#a != b#
    implies [code]#b != a#) and transitive (i.e. [code]#a == b && b == c#
    implies [code]#c == a#).

Some <<sycl-runtime>> classes will have additional behavior associated
with copy, movement, assignment or destruction semantics. If these are
specified they are in addition to those specified above unless stated
otherwise.

Each of the runtime classes mentioned above must provide a common
interface of special member functions and member functions in order to
fulfill the copy, move, destruction and equality requirements,
following the <<rule-of-five>> and the <<rule-of-zero>>.

These common special member functions and hidden friend functions are

=== Properties

Each of the following <<sycl-runtime>> classes:
[code]#accessor#,
[code]#buffer#,
[code]#host_accessor#,
[code]#host_sampled_image_accessor#,
[code]#host_unsampled_image_accessor#,
[code]#context#,
[code]#local_accessor#,
[code]#queue#,
[code]#sampled_image#,
[code]#sampled_image_accessor#,
[code]#stream#,
[code]#unsampled_image#,
[code]#unsampled_image_accessor# and
[code]#usm_allocator#
provide an optional parameter in each of
their constructors to provide a [code]#property_list# which
contains zero or more properties. Each of those properties augments
the semantics of the class with a particular feature. Each of those
classes must also provide [code]#has_property# and
[code]#get_property# member functions for querying for a
particular property.

The listing below illustrates the usage of various buffer properties,
described in <<sec:buffer-properties>>.

The example illustrates how using properties does not affect the type
of the object, thus, does not prevent the usage of SYCL objects in
containers.

[source,,linenums]
----
include::{code_dir}/propertyExample.cpp[lines=4..-1]
----

Each property is represented by a unique class and an instance of a property
is an instance of that type. Some properties can be default constructed
while others will require an argument on construction. A property may be
applicable to more than one class, however some properties may not be
compatible with each other. See the requirements for the properties of the
SYCL [code]#buffer# class, SYCL [code]#unsampled_image# class and
SYCL [code]#sampled_image# class in <<table.properties.buffer>>
and <<table.properties.image>> respectively.

Properties can be passed to a <<sycl-runtime>> class
via an instance of [code]#property_list#.
These properties get tied to the <<sycl-runtime>> class instance
and copies of the object will contain the same properties.

A SYCL implementation or a <<backend>> may provide additional properties
other than those defined here, provided they are defined in accordance with
the requirements described in <<sec:headers-and-namespaces>>.

==== Properties interface

Each of the runtime classes mentioned above must provide a common
interface of member functions in order to fulfill the property
interface requirements.

A synopsis of the common properties interface, the SYCL
[code]#property_list# class and the SYCL property classes is provided
below. The member functions of the common properties interface are listed in
<<table.members.propertyinterface>>. The constructors of the SYCL
[code]#property_list# class are listed in
<<table.constructors.propertylist>>.

[[sec:device-selection]]
=== Device selection

Since a system can have several SYCL-compatible devices attached, it
is useful to have a way to select a specific device or a set of
devices to construct a specific object such as a
[code]#device# (see <<sec:device-class>>) or a
[code]#queue# (see <<sec:interface.queue.class>>), or
perform some operations on a device subset.

Device selection is done either by already having a specific instance
of a [code]#device# (see <<sec:device-class>>) or by
providing a <<device-selector>> which is a ranking function that will give
an integer ranking value to all the devices on the system.


[[sec:device-selector]]
==== Device selector

The actual interface for a <<device-selector>> is a callable
taking a [code]#const device# reference and returning a
value implicitly convertible to an [code]#int#.

At any point where the <<sycl-runtime>> needs to select a SYCL
[code]#device# using a <<device-selector>>, the system will query
all available SYCL [code]#devices# from all <<backend, SYCL backends>> in the
system, will call the <<device-selector>> on each device and select the one
which returns the highest score. If the highest value is strictly
negative no device is selected.

In places where only one device has to be picked and the high score is
obtained by more than one device, then one of the tied devices will be
returned, but which one is not defined and may depend on enumeration
order, for example, outside the control of the SYCL runtime.

Some predefined <<device-selector,device selectors>> are provided by the system as
described on <<table.device.selectors>> in a header file with
some definition similar to the following:

available on the system.

----
a@ The free function [code]#aspect_selector# has several overloads,
each of which returns a selector object that selects a
SYCL [code]#device# from any supported <<backend>>
which contains all the requested aspects,
i.e. for the specific device [code]#dev#
and each aspect [code]#devAspect# from [code]#aspectList#
[code]#dev.has(devAspect)# equals [code]#true#.
If no aspects are passed in,
the generated selector behaves like [code]#default_selector#.

Required aspects can be passed in as a vector, as function arguments,
or as template parameters, depending on the function overload.
The function overload that takes [code]#aspectList# as a vector
takes another vector argument [code]#denyList#
where the user can specify all the aspects that have to be avoided,
i.e. for the specific device [code]#dev#
and each aspect [code]#devAspect# from [code]#denyList#
[code]#dev.has(devAspect)# equals [code]#false#.

The SYCL class constructor using the generated selector
must throw an [code]#exception# with the [code]#errc::runtime# error code
if no device matching this requirement can be found.
There are multiple overloads of this function,
please refer to <<header:device-selector>> for full definitions
and to <<example:aspect-selector>> for examples.

Typical examples of default and user-provided <<device-selector,device selectors>> could be:

[source,,linenums]
----
sycl::device my_gpu { sycl::gpu_selector_v };

sycl::queue my_accelerator { sycl::accelerator_selector_v };

int prefer_my_vendor(const sycl::device & d) {
  // Return 1 if the vendor name is "MyVendor" or 0 else.
  // 0 does not prevent another device to be picked as a second choice
  return d.get_info<info::device::vendor>() == "MyVendor";
}

// Get the preferred device or another one if not available
sycl::device preferred_device { prefer_my_vendor };

// This throws if there is no such device in the system
sycl::queue half_precision_controller {
  // Can use a lambda as a device ranking function.
  // Returns a negative number to fail in the case there is no such device
  [] (auto &d) { return d.has(sycl::aspect::fp16) ? 1 : -1; }
};

// To ease porting SYCL 1.2.1 code, there are types whose
// construction leads to the equivalent predefined device selector
sycl::queue my_old_style_gpu { sycl::gpu_selector {} };
----

Examples of using [code]#aspect_selector#:

[[example:aspect-selector]]
[source,,linenums]
----
using namespace sycl; // (optional) avoids need for "sycl::" before SYCL names

// Unrestrained selection, equivalent to default_selector
auto dev0 = device{aspect_selector()};

// Pass aspects in a vector
// Only accept CPUs that support half
auto dev1 = device{aspect_selector(std::vector{aspect::cpu, aspect::fp16})};

// Pass aspects without a vector
// Only accept GPUs that support half
auto dev2 = device{aspect_selector(aspect::gpu, aspect::fp16)};

// Pass aspects as compile-time parameters
// Only accept devices that can be debugged on host and support half
auto dev3 = device{aspect_selector<aspect::host_debuggable, aspect::fp16>()};

// Pass aspects in an allowlist and a denylist
// Only accept devices that support half and double floating point precision,
// but exclude emulated devices and devices of type "custom"
auto dev4 = device{aspect_selector(
   std::vector{aspect::fp16, aspect::fp64},
   std::vector{aspect::emulated, aspect::custom}
)};
----

[NOTE]
====
In SYCL 1.2.1 the predefined device selectors were actually types
that had to be instantiated to be used. Now they are just
instances. To simplify porting code using the old type
instantiations, a backward-compatible API is still provided, such as
[code]#sycl::default_selector#. The new predefined device
selectors have their new names appended with "_v" to avoid
conflicts, thus following the naming style used by traits in the {cpp}
standard library. There is no requirement for the implementation to
have for example [code]#sycl::gpu_selector_v# being an instance
of [code]#sycl::gpu_selector#.
====

NOTE: Implementation note: the SYCL API might rely on SFINAE or {cpp20}
concepts to resolve some ambiguity in constructors with default
parameters.


[[sec:platform-class]]
=== Platform class

The SYCL [code]#platform# class encapsulates a single SYCL platform on
which SYCL kernel functions may be executed. A SYCL platform must be
associated with a single <<backend>>.

A SYCL [code]#platform# is also associated with one or more SYCL
[code]#devices# associated with the same <<backend>>.

All member functions of the [code]#platform# class are synchronous and
errors are handled by throwing synchronous SYCL exceptions.

The execution environment for a SYCL application has a fixed number of
platforms which does not vary as the application executes.  The application
can get a list of all these platforms via [code]#platform::get_platforms()#.
The [code]#platform# class also provides constructors, but constructing a new
[code]#platform# instance merely creates a new object that is a copy of one
of the objects returned by [code]#platform::get_platforms()#.

The SYCL [code]#platform# class provides the common reference semantics
(see <<sec:reference-semantics>>).

==== Platform interface

A synopsis of the SYCL [code]#platform# class is provided below. The
constructors, member functions and static member functions of the SYCL
[code]#platform# class are listed in
<<table.constructors.platform>>, <<table.members.platform>> and
<<table.staticmembers.platform>> respectively. The additional common
special member functions and common member functions are listed in

[[sec:interface.context.class]]
=== Context class

The <<context>> class represents a SYCL <<context>>. A <<context>>
represents the runtime data structures and state required by a <<backend>>
API to interact with a group of devices associated with a platform.

The SYCL [code]#context# class provides the common reference semantics
(see <<sec:reference-semantics>>).


==== Context interface

The constructors and member functions of the SYCL [code]#context# class
are listed in <<table.constructors.context>> and
<<table.members.context>>, respectively. The additional common special
member functions and common member functions are listed in
<<sec:reference-semantics>> in
<<table.specialmembers.common.reference>> and
<<table.hiddenfriends.common.reference>>, respectively.

All member functions of the <<context>> class are synchronous and errors
are handled by throwing synchronous SYCL exceptions.

All constructors of the SYCL <<context>> class will construct an
instance associated with a particular <<backend>>, determined by the
constructor parameters or, in the case of the default constructor, the
SYCL [code]#device# produced by the
[code]#default_selector_v#.

A SYCL [code]#context# can optionally be constructed with an
[code]#async_handler# parameter. In this case the
[code]#async_handler# is used to report asynchronous SYCL exceptions,
as described in <<error-handling>>.

Information about a SYCL <<context>> may be queried through the
[code]#get_info()# member function.

A SYCL [code]#device# can be partitioned into multiple SYCL devices, by
calling the [code]#create_sub_devices()# member function template. The
resulting SYCL [code]#devices# are considered sub devices, and it is
valid to partition these sub devices further. The range of support for this

[[sec:device-aspects]]
==== Device aspects

Every SYCL <<device>> has an associated set of <<aspect,aspects>> which
identify characteristics of the [code]#device#.  Aspects are defined via
the [code]#enum class aspect# enumeration:

[source,,linenums]
----
include::{header_dir}/deviceEnumClassAspect.h[lines=4..-1]
----

SYCL applications can query the aspects for a [code]#device# via
[code]#device::has()# in order to determine whether the [code]#device#
supports any optional features.  <<table.device.aspect>> lists the aspects that
are defined in the <<core-spec>> and tells which optional features correspond
to each.  Backends and extensions may provide additional aspects and additional
optional device features.  If so, the <<backend>> specification document or the
extension document describes them.

a@
[source]
----
aspect::custom
----
   a@ A dedicated accelerator that can use the SYCL API, but programmable kernels
      cannot be dispatched to the device, only fixed functionality is available.
      See <<sec:pre-defined-kernels>>.  Devices with this
      [code]#aspect# have device type [code]#info::device_type::custom#.

a@
[source]
----
aspect::emulated
----
   a@ Indicates that the device is somehow emulated.  A device with this aspect
   is not intended for performance, and instead will generally have another
   purpose such as emulation or profiling.  The precise definition of this
   aspect is left open to the SYCL implementation.

[NOTE]
====
As an example, a vendor might support both a hardware FPGA device and a
software emulated FPGA, where the emulated FPGA has all the same features
as the hardware one but runs more slowly and can provide additional profiling
or diagnostic information.  In such a case, an application's
<<device-selector>> can use [code]#aspect::emulated# to distinguish the two.

----
aspect::usm_shared_allocations
----
   a@ Indicates that the device supports USM memory allocated via
      [code]#usm::alloc::shared# on the same device. Concurrent access
      and atomic modification of a shared allocation is only supported
      if [code]#aspect::usm_atomic_shared_allocations# is also supported.
      (See <<sec:usm>>.)

a@
[source]

----
   a@ Indicates that the device supports USM memory allocated via
      [code]#usm::alloc::shared#. The host and other devices in the same
      context that also support this capability may concurrently access
      and atomically modify shared allocations.  The allocation is free

      allocation mechanisms for [code]#usm::alloc::shared# allocations on
      this device.  (See <<sec:usm>>.)

|====

The implementation also provides two traits that the application can use to
query aspects at compilation time.  The trait [code]#any_device_has<aspect>#
inherits from [code]#std::true_type# if the compilation environment supports
any device which has the specified aspect, and it inherits from
[code]#std::false_type# if no device has the aspect.  The trait
[code]#all_devices_have<aspect># inherits from [code]#std::true_type# if all
devices supported by the compilation environment have the specified aspect,
and it inherits from [code]#std::false_type# if any device does not have the
aspect.

[source,,linenums]
----
include::{header_dir}/aspectTraits.h[lines=4..-1]
----

Applications can use these traits to reduce their code size.  The following
example demonstrates one way to use these traits to avoid instantiating a
templated kernel for device features that are not supported by any device.

[source,,linenums]
----
include::{code_dir}/aspectTraitExample.cpp[lines=4..-1]
----

The kernel function [code]#MyKernel# is templated to use a different
algorithm depending on whether the device has the aspect [code]#aspect::fp16#,
and the call to [code]#dev.has()# chooses the kernel function instantiation
that matches the device's capabilities.  However, the use of
[code]#any_device_has_v# and [code]#all_devices_have_v# entirely avoid
useless instantiations of the kernel function.  For example, when the
compilation environment does not support any devices with [code]#aspect::fp16#,
[code]#any_device_has_v<aspect::fp16># is [code]#false#, and the kernel
function is never instantiated with support for the [code]#sycl::half# type.

[NOTE]
====
Like any trait, the values of [code]#any_device_has_v# and
[code]#all_devices_have_v# have a uniform value across all parts of a SYCL
application.  If an implementation uses <<smcp>>, all compiler passes define a
particular aspect's specialization of the traits the same way, regardless of
whether that compiler pass' device supports the aspect.  Thus,
[code]#any_device_has# and [code]#all_devices_have# cannot be used to determine
whether any particular device supports an aspect.  Instead, applications must
use [code]#device::has()# or [code]#platform::has()# for this.
====

[NOTE]
====
An implementation could choose to provide command line options which affect the
set of devices that it supports.  If so, those command line options would also
affect these traits.  For example, if an implementation provides a command line
option that disables [code]#aspect::accelerator# devices, the trait
[code]#any_device_has_v<aspect::accelerator># would be [code]#false# when that
command line option was specified.

[[sec:interface.queue.class]]
=== Queue class

// \input{queue_class}
// %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% begin queue_class %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The SYCL [code]#queue# class encapsulates a single SYCL queue which
schedules kernels on a SYCL device.

A SYCL [code]#queue# can be used to submit <<command-group,command groups>> to be
executed by the <<sycl-runtime>> using the [code]#submit# member
function.

All member functions of the [code]#queue# class are synchronous and errors
are handled by throwing synchronous SYCL exceptions. The [code]#submit#
member function schedules <<command-group,command groups>> asynchronously, so any errors
in the submission of a <<command-group>> are handled by throwing synchronous
SYCL exceptions. Any exceptions from the <<command-group>> after it has
been submitted are handled by passing <<async-error,asynchronous errors>> at specific times to an
<<async-handler>>, as described in <<error-handling>>.

A SYCL [code]#queue# can wait for all <<command-group,command groups>> that it has
submitted by calling [code]#wait# or [code]#wait_and_throw#.

The default constructor of the SYCL [code]#queue# class will
construct a queue based on the SYCL [code]#device# returned from
the [code]#default_selector_v# (see <<sec:device-selector>>).
All other constructors construct a queue as determined by the
parameters provided. All constructors will implicitly construct a SYCL
[code]#platform#, [code]#device# and [code]#context# in order to
facilitate the construction of the queue.

Each constructor takes as the last
parameter an optional SYCL [code]#property_list# to provide properties to
the SYCL [code]#queue#.

The SYCL [code]#queue# class provides the common reference semantics
(see <<sec:reference-semantics>>).


==== Queue interface

A synopsis of the SYCL [code]#queue# class is provided below. The
constructors and member functions of the SYCL [code]#queue# class are
listed in <<table.constructors.queue>> and <<table.members.queue>>
respectively. The additional common special member functions and common member
functions are listed in <<sec:reference-semantics>> in
<<table.specialmembers.common.reference>> and
<<table.hiddenfriends.common.reference>>, respectively.

Some queue member functions are shortcuts to member functions of the [code]#handler# class.
These are listed in <<sec:queue-shortcuts>>.

[[sec:queue-shortcuts]]
==== Queue shortcut functions

Queue shortcut functions are member functions of the [code]#queue# class
that implicitly create a command group with an implicit command group [code]#handler#
consisting of a single command,
a call to the member function of the handler object with the same signature
(e.g. [code]#queue::single_task# will call [code]#handler::single_task# with the same arguments),
and submit the command group.
The main signature difference comes from the return type:
member functions of the [code]#handler# return [code]#void#,
whereas corresponding queue shortcut functions return an [code]#event# object
that represents the submitted command group.
Queue shortcuts can additionally take a list of events to wait on,
as if passing the event list to [code]#handler::depends_on# for the implicit command group.

The full list of queue shortcuts is defined in <<table.queue.shortcuts>>.
The list of handler member functions is defined in <<table.members.handler.kernel>>.

It is not allowed to capture accessors into the implicitly created command group.
If a queue shortcut function launches a kernel
(via [code]#single_task# or [code]#parallel_for#),
only USM pointers are allowed inside such kernels.
However, queue shortcuts that perform non-kernel operations
can be provided with a valid placeholder accessor as an argument.
In that case there is an additional step performed:
the implicit command group [code]#handler# calls [code]#handler::require#
on each accessor passed in as a function argument.

An example of using queue shortcuts is shown below.

[[sec:interface.queue.errors]]
==== Queue error handling

Queue errors come in two forms:

  * *Synchronous Errors* are those that we would expect to be
    reported directly at the point of waiting on an event, and hence waiting
    for a queue to complete, as well as any immediate errors reported by
    enqueuing work onto a queue. Such errors are reported through {cpp}
    exceptions.
  * <<async-error,Asynchronous errors>> are those that are produced or detected after
    associated host API calls have returned (so can't be thrown as
    exceptions by the API call), and that are handled by an
    <<async-handler>> through which the errors are reported. Handling of
    asynchronous errors from a queue occurs at specific times, as described
    by <<error-handling>>.

Note that if there are <<async-error,asynchronous errors>> to be processed when a queue
is destructed, the handler is called and
this might delay or block the destruction, according to the behavior
of the handler.


// %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% end queue_class %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

[[sec:interface.event]]
=== Event class

An <<event>> in SYCL is an object that represents the status of an operation
that is being executed by the SYCL runtime.

Typically in SYCL, data dependency and execution order is handled implicitly by
the SYCL runtime. However, in some circumstances developers want fine grain control
of the execution, or want to retrieve properties of a command that is running.

Note that, although an event represents the status of a particular operation,
the dependencies of a certain event can be used to keep track of multiple steps
required to synchronize said operation.

A SYCL event is returned by the submission of a <<command-group>>.
The dependencies of the event returned via the submission of the command group
are the implementation-defined commands associated with the <<command-group>>
execution.

The SYCL [code]#event# class provides the common reference semantics
(see <<sec:reference-semantics>>).

The constructors and member functions of the SYCL [code]#event# class
are listed in <<table.constructors.event>> and
<<table.members.event>>, respectively. The additional common special
member functions and common member functions are listed in
<<table.specialmembers.common.reference>> and
<<table.hiddenfriends.common.reference>>, respectively.

[[sec:data.access.and.storage]]
== Data access and storage in SYCL

In SYCL, when using <<buffer,buffers>> and <<image,images>>,
data storage and access are handled by separate classes.
<<buffer,Buffers>> and <<image,images>> handle
storage and ownership of the data, whereas <<accessor,accessors>> handle access to
the data.
Buffers and images in SYCL can be bound to more than one device or context,
including across different <<backend, SYCL backends>>.
They also handle ownership of the
data, while allowing exception handling for blocking
and non-blocking data transfers. Accessors manage data transfers between the host
and all of the devices in the system, as well as tracking of data dependencies.

Zero-sized buffers are permitted. In this case, the buffer still handles ownership as
normal, but does not need to store the zero-sized data itself.

When using <<usm>> allocations, data storage is managed by USM allocation functions, and
data access is via pointers.  See <<sec:usm>> for greater detail.

=== Host allocation

A <<sycl-runtime>> may need to allocate temporary objects on the host
to handle some operations (such as copying data from one context to
another).
Allocation on the host is managed using an allocator object, following the
standard {cpp} allocator class definition.
The default allocator for memory objects is implementation-defined,
but the user can supply their own allocator class.

[source,,linenums]
----
{
    buffer<int, 1, UserDefinedAllocator<int>> b(d);
}
----

When an allocator returns a [code]#nullptr#, the runtime cannot allocate data on the
host. Note that in this case the runtime will raise an error if it requires
host memory but it is not available (e.g when moving data across <<backend>>
contexts).

The definition of allocators extends the current functionality of SYCL,
ensuring that users can define allocator functions for specific hardware or
certain complex shared memory mechanisms (e.g. NUMA), and improves
interoperability with STL-based libraries (e.g, Intel's TBB provides an
allocator).


[[subsec:default.allocators]]
==== Default allocators

A default allocator is always defined by the implementation. For allocations
greater than size zero, it is guaranteed to return non-[code]#nullptr# and
new memory positions every call.
The default allocator for const buffers will remove the const-ness of the
type (therefore, the default allocator for a buffer of type [code]#const int#
will be an [code]#Allocator<int>)#.
This implies that host <<accessor,accessors>> will not synchronize with the pointer given
by the user in the buffer/image constructor, but will use the memory
returned by the [code]#Allocator# itself for that purpose.
The user can implement an allocator that returns the same address as the
one passed in the buffer constructor, but it is the responsibility of the
user to handle the potential race conditions.

[[subsec:buffers]]
=== Buffers

The [code]#buffer# class defines a shared array of one, two or three
dimensions that can be used by the SYCL <<kernel>> and has to be accessed using
<<accessor>> classes. Buffers are templated on both the type of their data,
and the number of dimensions that the data is stored and accessed through.

A [code]#buffer# does not map to only one underlying backend
object, and all <<backend>> memory objects may be temporary for use
within a command group on a specific device.

The underlying data type of a buffer [code]#T# must be <<device-copyable>> as
defined in <<sec::device.copyable>>.  Some overloads of the [code]#buffer#
constructor initialize the buffer contents by copying objects from host memory
while other overloads construct the buffer without copying objects from the
host.  For the overloads that do not copy host objects, the initial state of
the objects in the buffer depends on whether [code]#T# is an implicit-lifetime
type (as defined in the {cpp} core language).  If [code]#T# is an
implicit-lifetime type, objects of that type are implicitly created in the
buffer with indeterminate values.  For other types, these constructor overloads
merely allocate uninitialized memory, and the application is responsible for
constructing objects by calling placement-new and for destroying them later
by manually calling the object's destructor.

A SYCL [code]#buffer# can construct an instance of a SYCL [code]#buffer#
that reinterprets the original SYCL [code]#buffer# with a different
type, dimensionality and range using the member function
[code]#reinterpret#. The reinterpreted SYCL [code]#buffer# that is
constructed must behave as though it were a copy of the SYCL [code]#buffer#
that constructed it (see <<sec:reference-semantics>>) with the exception
that the type, dimensionality and range of the reinterpreted SYCL
[code]#buffer# must reflect the type, dimensionality and range specified
when calling the [code]#reinterpret# member function. By extension of this,
the class member types [code]#value_type#, [code]#reference# and
[code]#const_reference#, and the member functions [code]#get_range()#
and [code]#size()# of the reinterpreted SYCL [code]#buffer# must
reflect the new type, dimensionality and range. The data that the original SYCL
[code]#buffer# and the reinterpreted SYCL [code]#buffer# manage
remains unaffected, though the representation of the data when accessed through
the reinterpreted SYCL [code]#buffer# may alter to reflect the new type,
dimensionality and range. It is important to note that a reinterpreted SYCL
[code]#buffer# is a copy of the original SYCL [code]#buffer# only,
and not a new SYCL [code]#buffer#. Constructing more than one SYCL
[code]#buffer# managing the same host pointer is still undefined behavior.

The SYCL [code]#buffer# class template provides the common reference
semantics (see <<sec:reference-semantics>>).


==== Buffer interface

The constructors and member functions of the SYCL [code]#buffer# class
template are listed in <<table.constructors.buffer>> and
<<table.members.buffer>>, respectively. The additional common special
member functions and common member functions are listed in
<<table.specialmembers.common.reference>> and
<<table.hiddenfriends.common.reference>>, respectively.

Each constructor takes as the last parameter an optional SYCL
[code]#property_list# to provide properties to the SYCL
[code]#buffer#.

The SYCL [code]#buffer# class template takes a template parameter
[code]#AllocatorT# for specifying an allocator which is used by
the <<sycl-runtime>> when allocating temporary memory on the
host. If no template argument is provided, then the default allocator
for the SYCL [code]#buffer# class [code]#buffer_allocator<T>#
will be used (see <<subsec:default.allocators>>).

[width="100%",options="header",separator="@",cols="65%,35%"]
|====
@ Property @ Description
a@
[source]
----
property::buffer::use_host_ptr
----
   a@ The [code]#use_host_ptr# property adds the requirement that the <<sycl-runtime>> must not allocate any memory for the SYCL [code]#buffer# and instead uses the provided host pointer directly. This prevents the <<sycl-runtime>> from allocating additional temporary storage on the host.

This property has a special guarantee for buffers that are constructed from a
[code]#hostData# pointer.  If a [code]#host_accessor# is constructed from such
a buffer, then the address of the [code]#reference# type returned from the
accessor's member functions such as [code]#operator[](id<>)# will be the same
as the corresponding [code]#hostData# address.

a@
[source]
----
property::buffer::use_mutex
----
   a@ The [code]#use_mutex# property is valid for the SYCL
      [code]#buffer#, [code]#unsampled_image# and
      [code]#sampled_image# classes. The property adds the
      requirement that the memory which is owned by the SYCL
      [code]#buffer# can be shared with the application via a
      [code]#std::mutex# provided to the property. The mutex
      [code]#m# is locked by the runtime whenever the data is in
      use and unlocked otherwise. Data is synchronized with
      [code]#hostData#, when the mutex is unlocked by the runtime.

a@

----
property::buffer::context_bound
----
   a@ The [code]#context_bound# property adds the requirement that the SYCL [code]#buffer# can only be associated with a single SYCL [code]#context# that is provided to the property.

[[sec:buf-sync-rules]]
==== Buffer synchronization rules

Buffers are reference-counted. When a buffer value is constructed
from another buffer, the two values reference the same buffer and a
reference count is incremented. When a buffer value is destroyed,
the reference count is decremented. Only when there are no more
buffer values that reference a specific buffer is the actual
buffer destroyed and the buffer destruction behavior defined
below is followed.

If any error occurs on buffer destruction, it is reported
via the associated queue's asynchronous error handling mechanism.

The basic rule for the blocking behavior of a buffer destructor is
that it blocks if there is some data to write back because a
write accessor on it has been created, or if the buffer was constructed
with attached host memory and is still in use.

More precisely:

  . A buffer can be constructed with just a size and using the default
    buffer allocator. The memory management for this type of buffer is
    entirely handled by the SYCL system. The destructor for this type of
    buffer does not need to block, even if work on the buffer has not
    completed. Instead, the SYCL system frees any storage required for the
    buffer asynchronously when it is no longer in use in queues. The initial
    contents of the buffer are unspecified.
  . A buffer can be constructed with associated host memory and a default
    buffer allocator. The buffer will use this host memory for its full
    lifetime, but the contents of this host memory are unspecified for the
    lifetime of the buffer. If the host memory is modified by the host, or
    mapped to another buffer or image during the lifetime of this buffer,
    then the results are undefined. The initial contents of the buffer will
    be the contents of the host memory at the time of construction.
+
--
When the buffer is destroyed, the destructor will block until all
work in queues on the buffer have completed, then copy the contents
of the buffer back to the host memory (if required) and then
return.

  .. If the type of the host data is [code]#const#, then the buffer is
    read-only; only read accessors are allowed on the buffer and
    no-copy-back to host memory is performed (although the host memory must
    still be kept available for use by SYCL). When using the default buffer
    allocator, the const-ness of the type will be removed in order to allow
    host allocation of memory, which will allow temporary host copies of the
    data by the <<sycl-runtime>>, for example for speeding up host
    accesses.
+
When the buffer is destroyed, the destructor will block until all work
in queues on the buffer have completed and then return, as there is no
copy of data back to host.
  .. If the type of the host data is not [code]#const# but the pointer
    to host data is [code]#const#, then the read-only restriction
    applies only on host and not on device accesses.
+
When the buffer is destroyed, the destructor will block until all work
in queues on the buffer have completed.
--
  . A buffer can be constructed using a [code]#shared_ptr# to host
    data. This pointer is shared between the SYCL application and the
    runtime. In order to allow synchronization between the application and
    the runtime a [code]#mutex# is used which will be locked by the
    runtime whenever the data is in use, and unlocked when it is no longer
    needed.
+
--
The [code]#shared_ptr# reference counting is used in order to prevent
destroying the buffer host data prematurely. If the [code]#shared_ptr#
is deleted from the user application before buffer destruction, the buffer
can continue securely because the pointer hasn't been destroyed yet. It will
not copy data back to the host before destruction, however, as the
application side has already deleted its copy.

Note that since there is an implicit conversion of a
[code]#std::unique_ptr# to a [code]#std::shared_ptr#, a
[code]#std::unique_ptr# can also be used to pass the ownership to the
<<sycl-runtime>>.
--
  . A buffer can be constructed from a pair of iterator values. In this
    case, the buffer construction will copy the data from the data range
    defined by the iterator pair. The destructor will not copy back any data
    and does not need to block.

  . A buffer can be constructed from a container on which
    [code]#std::data(container)# and [code]#std::size(container)#
    are well-formed. The initial contents of the buffer will
    be the contents of the container at the time of construction.
+
--
The buffer may use the memory within the container for its full
lifetime, and the contents of this memory are unspecified for the
lifetime of the buffer. If the container memory is modified by the host
during the lifetime of this buffer, then the results are undefined.

When the buffer is destroyed, if the return type of
[code]#std::data(container)# is not [code]#const# then the destructor
will block until all work in queues on the buffer have completed, and will
then copy the contents of the buffer to the container (if required)
and then return.
--


If [code]#set_final_data()# is used to change where to write the
data back to, then the destructor of the buffer will block if a
write accessor on it has been created.

A sub-buffer object can be created which is a sub-range reference to a
base buffer. This sub-buffer can be used to create accessors to the
base buffer, which have access to the range specified at time
of construction of the sub-buffer.  Sub-buffers cannot be created from
sub-buffers, but only from a base buffer which is not already a sub-buffer.

Sub-buffers must be constructed from a contiguous region of memory in a
buffer. This requirement is potentially non-intuitive when working with
buffers that have dimensionality larger than one, but maps to
one-dimensional <<backend>> native allocations without performance cost due
to index mapping computation. For example:

[[subsec:images]]
=== Images

The classes [code]#unsampled_image#
(<<table.constructors.unsampledImage>>) and [code]#sampled_image#
(<<table.constructors.sampledImage>>) define shared image data of one,
two or three dimensions, that can be used by kernels in queues and have to be
accessed using the image <<accessor>> classes.

The constructors and member functions of the SYCL [code]#unsampled_image#
and [code]#sampled_image# class templates are listed in
<<table.constructors.unsampledImage>>, <<table.members.unsampledImage>>,
<<table.constructors.sampledImage>> and <<table.members.sampledImage>>,
respectively. The additional common special member functions and common member
functions are listed in <<table.specialmembers.common.reference>> and
<<table.hiddenfriends.common.reference>>, respectively.

Where relevant, it is the responsibility of the user to ensure that the format
of the data matches the format described by [code]#image_format#.

The allocator template parameter of the SYCL [code]#unsampled_image# and
[code]#sampled_image# classes can be any allocator type including a custom
allocator, however it must allocate in units of [code]#std::byte#.

For any image that is constructed with the range latexmath:[(r1,r2,r3)] with an element
type size in bytes of _s_, the image row pitch and image slice pitch should be
calculated as follows:

[[image-row-pitch]]
[latexmath]
++++
r1 \cdot s
++++

[[image-slice-pitch]]
[latexmath]
++++
r1 \cdot r2 \cdot s
++++

The SYCL [code]#unsampled_image# and [code]#sampled_image# class
templates provide the common reference semantics
(see <<sec:reference-semantics>>).


==== Unsampled image interface

Each constructor of the [code]#unsampled_image# takes an
[code]#image_format# to describe the data layout of the image data.

Each constructor additionally takes as the last parameter an optional SYCL
[code]#property_list# to provide properties to the SYCL
[code]#unsampled_image#.

The SYCL [code]#unsampled_image# class template takes a template parameter
[code]#AllocatorT# for specifying an allocator which is used by the
<<sycl-runtime>> when allocating temporary memory on the host. If no template
argument is provided, the default allocator for the SYCL
[code]#unsampled_image# class [code]#image_allocator# is used
(see <<subsec:default.allocators>>).

[[sec:image-sync-rules]]
==== Image synchronization rules

The rules are similar to those described in <<sec:buf-sync-rules>>.

For the lifetime of the image object, the associated host memory must
be left available to the <<sycl-runtime>> and the contents of the associated
host memory is unspecified until the image object is destroyed. If an
image object value is copied, then only a reference to the underlying
image object is copied. The underlying image object is reference-counted.
Only after all image value references to the underlying image object
have been destroyed is the actual image object itself destroyed.

If an image object is constructed with associated host memory, then
its destructor blocks until all operations in all SYCL queues on
that image object have completed. Any modifications to the image data
will be copied back, if necessary, to the associated host memory.
Any errors occurring during destruction are reported to any associated
context's asynchronous error handler. If an image object is constructed
with a storage object, then the storage object defines what
synchronization or copying behavior occurs on image object destruction.


[[sec:sharing-host-memory-with-dm]]
=== Sharing host memory with the SYCL data management classes

In order to allow the <<sycl-runtime>> to do memory management and allow
for data dependencies, there are two classes defined, buffer and image. The
default behavior for them is that a "`raw`" pointer is given during the
construction of the data management class, with full ownership to use it until
the destruction of the SYCL object.

In this section we go in greater detail on sharing or explicitly not
sharing host memory with the SYCL data classes, and we will use the buffer
class as an example. The same rules will apply to images as well.


==== Default behavior

When using a SYCL buffer, the ownership of the pointer passed to the constructor
of the class is, by default, passed to <<sycl-runtime>>, and that pointer cannot be used
on the host side until the buffer or image is destroyed.
A SYCL application can use memory managed by a SYCL buffer within the buffer scope
by using a [code]#host_accessor# as defined in <<subsec:accessors>>.
However, there is no guarantee that the host accessor synchronizes with the
original host address used in its constructor.

The pointer passed in is the one used to copy data back to the host, if needed,
before buffer destruction.  The memory pointed by <<host-pointer>>
will not be de-allocated by the runtime,
and the data is copied back from the device if there is
a need for it.


==== SYCL ownership of the host memory

In the case where there is host memory to be used for initialization of data
but there is no intention of using that host memory after the buffer is
destroyed, then the buffer can take full ownership of that host memory.

When a buffer owns the <<host-pointer>> there is no copy back, by
default.  In this situation, the SYCL application may pass a unique
pointer to the host data, which will be then used by the runtime
internally to initialize the data in the device.

For example, the following could be used:

[source,,linenums]
----
{
  auto ptr = std::make_unique<int>(-1234);
  buffer<int, 1> b { std::move(ptr), range { 1 } };
  // ptr is not valid anymore.
  // There is nowhere to copy data back
}
----

However, optionally the [code]#buffer::set_final_data()# can be
set to a [code]#std::weak_ptr# to enable copying data
back, to another host memory address that is going to be valid after
buffer construction.

[source,,linenums]
----
{
  auto ptr = std::make_unique<int>(-42);
  buffer<int, 1> b { std::move(ptr), range { 1 } };
  // ptr is not valid anymore.
  // There is nowhere to copy data back.
  // To get copy back, a location can be specified:
  b.set_final_data(std::weak_ptr<int> { .... })
}
----


==== Shared SYCL ownership of the host memory

When an instance of [code]#std::shared_ptr# is passed to the buffer
constructor, then the buffer object and the developer's application share
the memory region. If the shared pointer is still used on the application's
side then the data will be copied back from the buffer or image and will be
available to the application after the buffer or image is destroyed.

If the [code]#shared_ptr# is not empty, the contents of the referenced
memory are used to initialize the buffer.  If the [code]#shared_ptr# is
empty, then the buffer is created with uninitialized memory.

When the buffer is destroyed and the data have potentially been updated, if
the number of copies of the shared pointer outside the runtime is 0, there
is no user-side shared pointer to read the data. Therefore the data is not
copied out, and the buffer destructor does not need to wait for the data
processes to be finished, as the outcome is not needed on the application's
side.

This behavior can be overridden using the [code]#set_final_data()#
member function of the buffer class, which will by any means force the buffer
destructor to wait until the data is copied to wherever the
[code]#set_final_data()# member function has put the data (or not wait nor copy
if set final data is [code]#nullptr)#.

[source,,linenums]
----
{
  std::shared_ptr<int> ptr { data };
  {
    buffer<int, 1> b { ptr, range<2>{ 10, 10 } };
    // update the data
    [...]
  } // Data is copied back because there is an user side shared_ptr
}
----

[source,,linenums]
----
{
  std::shared_ptr<int> ptr { data };
  {
    buffer<int, 1> b { ptr, range<2>{ 10, 10 } };
    // update the data
    [...]
    ptr.reset();
  } // Data is not copied back, there is no user side shared_ptr.
}
----


[[subsec:mutex]]
=== Synchronization primitives

When the user wants to use the [code]#buffer# simultaneously in
the <<sycl-runtime>> and their own code (e.g. a multi-threaded
mechanism) and wants to use manual synchronization without using a
[code]#host_accessor#, a [code]#std::mutex# can be passed to the
[code]#buffer# constructor via the right [code]#property#.

The runtime promises to lock the mutex whenever the data is in use and
unlock it when it no longer needs it.

[source,,linenums]
----
{
  std::mutex m;
  auto shD = std::make_shared<int>(42)
  sycl::buffer b { shD, { sycl::property::buffer::use_mutex { m } } };
  {
    std::lock_guard lck { m };
    // User accesses the data
    do_something(shD);
    /* m is unlocked when lck goes out of scope, by normal end of this
       block but also if an exception is thrown for example */
  }
}
----

When the runtime releases the mutex the user is guaranteed that the data was
copied back on the shared pointer --- unless the final data destination has been
changed using the member function [code]#set_final_data()#.


[[subsec:accessors]]
=== Accessors

// \input{accessors}
// %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% begin accessors %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

<<accessor,Accessors>> provide three different capabilities: they provide
access to the data managed by a <<buffer>> or <<image>>, they provide access
to local memory on a <<device>>, and they define the *requirements* to memory
objects which determine the scheduling of <<kernel,kernels>> (see
<<sub.section.memmodel.app>>).

A memory object requirement is created when an accessor is constructed, unless
the accessor is a placeholder in which case the requirement is created when
the accessor is bound to a <<command>> by calling [code]#handler::require()#.

There are several different {cpp} classes that implement accessors:

* The [code]#accessor# class provides access to data in a [code]#buffer# from
  within a <<command>>.

* The [code]#host_accessor# class provides access to data in a [code]#buffer#
  from host code that is outside of a <<command>>.  These accessors are
  typically used in <<application-scope>>.

* The [code]#local_accessor# class provides access to device local memory from
  within a <<sycl-kernel-function>>.

* The [code]#unsampled_image_accessor# and [code]#sampled_image_accessor#
  classes provide access to data in an [code]#unsampled_image# and
  [code]#sampled_image# from within a <<command>>.

* The [code]#host_unsampled_image_accessor# and
  [code]#host_sampled_image_accessor# classes provide access to data in an
  [code]#unsampled_image# and [code]#sampled_image# from host code that is
  outside of a <<command>>.  These accessors are typically used in
  <<application-scope>>.

Accessor objects must always be constructed in host code, either in
<<command-group-scope>> or in <<application-scope>>.  Whether the constructor
blocks waiting for data to synchronize depends on the type of accessor.  Those
accessors which provide access to data within a <<command>> do not block.
Instead, these accessors define a requirement which influences the scheduling
of the <<command>>.  Those accessors which provide access to data from host
code do block until the data is available on the host.

For those accessors which provide access to data within a <<command>>, the
member functions which access data should only be called from within the
<<command>>.  Programs which call these member functions from outside of the
<<command>> are ill formed.  The sections below describe exactly which member
functions fall into this category.


==== Data type

All accessors have a [code]#DataT# template parameter which specifies the type
of each element that the accessor accesses.  For [code]#accessor# and
[code]#host_accessor#, this type must either match the type of each element in
the underlying [code]#buffer#, or it must be a [code]#const# qualified version
of that type.

For the image accessors ([code]#unsampled_image_accessor#,
[code]#sampled_image_accessor#, [code]#host_unsampled_image_accessor#, and
[code]#host_sampled_image_accessor#), [code]#DataT# must be one of:

* [code]#int4# ([code]#vec<int32_t,4>#),

==== Access modes

Most accessors have an [code]#AccessMode# template parameter which specifies
whether the accessor can read or write the underlying data.  This information
is used by the runtime when defining the requirements for the associated
<<command>>, and it tells the runtime whether data needs to be transferred to
or from a device before data can be accessed through the accessor.

The [code]#access_mode# enumeration, shown in <<table.accessors.accessmode>>,
describes the potential modes of an accessor.  However, not all accessor
classes support all modes, so see the description of each class for more
details.

==== Deduction tags

Some accessor constructors take a [code]#TagT# parameter, which is used to
deduce template arguments for the constructor's class.  Each of the access
modes in <<table.accessors.accessmode>> has an associated tag, but there are
additional tags which set other template parameters in addition to the access
mode.  The synopsis below shows the namespace scope variables that the
implementation provides as possible values for the [code]#TagT# parameter.

[source,,linenums]
----
include::{header_dir}/accessTags.h[lines=4..-1]
----

The precise meaning of these tags depends on the specific accessor class
that is being constructed, so they are described more fully below in the
section that pertains to each of the accessor types.


==== Properties

All accessor constructors accept a [code]#property_list# parameter, which
affects the semantics of the accessor.  <<table.accessors.properties>> shows
the set of all possible accessor properties and tells which properties are
allowed when constructing each accessor class.

[[table.accessors.properties]]
.Properties supported by accessors
[width="100%",options="header",cols="20%,35%,45%"]
|====
|Property |Allowed with |Description

|[code]#property::no_init#
|[code]#accessor# +
 [code]#host_accessor# +
 [code]#unsampled_image_accessor# +
 [code]#host_unsampled_image_accessor#
|This property is useful when an application expects to write new values to all
of the accessor's elements without reading their previous values.  The
implementation can use this information to avoid copying the accessor's data in
some cases.  Following is a more formal description.

This property is allowed only for accessors with [code]#access_mode::write# or
[code]#access_mode::read_write# access modes.  Attempting to construct an
[code]#access_mode::read# accessor with this property causes an
[code]#exception# with the [code]#errc::invalid# error code to be thrown.

The usage of this property is different depending on whether the accessor's
underlying data type [code]#DataT# is an implicit-lifetime type (as defined in
the {cpp} core language).  If it is an implicit-lifetime type, the accessor
implicitly creates objects of that type with indeterminate values.  The
application is not required to write values to each element of the accessor,
but unwritten elements of the accessor's buffer or image receive indeterminate
values, even if those buffer or image elements previously had defined values.
If this is a <<ranged-accessor>>, this applies only to the elements within the
accessor's range.  The values of unwritten elements outside of this range are
preserved.

If [code]#DataT# is not an implicit-lifetime type, the accessor merely
allocates uninitialized memory, and the application is responsible for
constructing objects in that memory (e.g. by calling placement-new).  The
application must create an object in each element of the accessor unless the
corresponding element of the underlying buffer did not previously contain an
object.  If this is a <<ranged-accessor>>, this applies only to the elements
within the accessor's range.  The content of objects in the buffer outside of
this range is preserved.
|====

[NOTE]
====
As stated above, the [code]#property::no_init# property requires the
application to construct an object for each accessor element when the element's
type is not an implicit-lifetime type (except in the case when the
corresponding buffer element did not previously contain an object).  The reason
for this requirement is to avoid the possibility of overwriting a valid object
with indeterminate bytes, for example, when a <<command>> using the accessor
completes.  This means that the implementation can unconditionally copy memory
from the device back to the host when the <<command>> completes, regardless of
whether the [code]#DataT# type is an implicit-lifetime type.

<<table.accessors.properties.constructors>>.

==== Read only accessors

Accessors which have an [code]#AccessMode# template parameter can be declared
as read-only by specifying [code]#access_mode::read# for the template
parameter.  A read-only accessor provides read-only access to the underlying
data and provides a "read" requirement for the memory object when it is
constructed.

The [code]#DataT# template parameter for a read-only accessor can optionally
be [code]#const# qualified, and the semantics of the accessor are unchanged.
For example, an accessor declared with [code]#const DataT# and
[code]#access_mode::read# has the same semantics as an accessor declared with
[code]#DataT# and [code]#access_mode::read#.

As detailed in the sections below, some accessor types have a default value
for [code]#AccessMode#, which depends on whether the [code]#DataT# parameter
is [code]#const# qualified.  This provides a convenient way to declare a
read-only accessor without explicitly specifying the access mode.

A [code]#const# qualified [code]#DataT# is only allowed for a read-only
accessor.  Programs which specify a [code]#const# qualified [code]#DataT# and
any access mode other than [code]#access_mode::read# are ill formed, and the
implementation must issue a diagnostic in this case.

Each accessor class also provides implicit conversions between the two forms
of read-only accessors.  This makes it possible, for example, to assign an
accessor whose type has [code]#const DataT# and [code]#access_mode::read# to an
accessor whose type has [code]#DataT# and [code]#access_mode::read#, so long as
the other template parameters are the same.  There is also an implicit
conversion from a read-write accessor to either of the forms of a read-only
accessor.  These implicit conversions are described in detail for each accessor
class in the sections that follow.


==== Accessing elements of an accessor

Accessors of type [code]#accessor#, [code]#host_accessor#, and
[code]#local_accessor# can have zero, one, two, or three Dimensions.  A zero
dimension accessor provides access to a single scalar element via an implicit
conversion operator to the underlying type of that element.

One, two, or three dimensional specializations of these accessors provide
access to the elements they contain in two ways.  The first way is through a
subscript operator that takes an instance of an [code]#id# class which has the
same dimensionality as the accessor.  The second way is by passing a single
[code]#size_t# value to multiple consecutive subscript operators as specified
in <<sec:multi-dim-subscript>>.

In all these cases, the reference to the contained element is of type
[code]#const DataT &# for read-only accessors and of type [code]#DataT &# for
other accessors.

Accessors of all types have a range that defines the set of indices that may be
used to access elements.  For buffer accessors, this is the range of the
underlying buffer, unless it is a <<ranged-accessor>> in which case the range
comes from the accessor's constructor.  For image accessors, this is the range
of the underlying image.  Local accessors specify the range when the accessor
is constructed.  Any attempt to access an element via an index that is outside
of this range produces undefined behavior.


==== Container interface

Accessors of type [code]#accessor#, [code]#host_accessor#, and
[code]#local_accessor# meet the {cpp} requirement of
[code]#ReversibleContainer#.  The exception to this is that only
[code]#local_accessor# owns the underlying data, meaning that its destructor
destroys elements and frees the memory.  The [code]#accessor# and
[code]#host_accessor# types don't destroy any elements or free the memory on
destruction.  The iterator for the container interface meets the {cpp}
requirement of [code]#LegacyRandomAccessIterator# and the underlying
pointers/references correspond to the address space specified by the accessor
type.  For multidimensional accessors the iterator linearizes the data
according to <<sec:multi-dim-linearization>>.


[[sec:accessors.ranged]]
==== Ranged accessors

Accessors of type [code]#accessor# and [code]#host_accessor# can be constructed
from a sub-range of a [code]#buffer# by providing a range and offset to the
constructor.  This limits the elements that can be accessed to the specified
sub-range, which allows the implementation to perform certain optimizations such
as reducing the amount of memory that needs to be copied to or from a device.

If the ranged accessor is multi-dimensional, the sub-range is allowed to
describe a region of memory in the underlying buffer that is not contiguous
in the linear address space.  It is also legal to construct several ranged
accessors for the same underlying buffer, either overlapping or
non-overlapping.

A ranged accessor still creates a requisite for the entire underlying buffer,
even for the portions not within the range.  For example, if one command writes
through a ranged accessor to one region of a buffer and a second command reads
through a ranged accessor from a non-overlapping region of the same buffer, the
second command must still be scheduled after the first because the requisites
for the two commands are on the entire buffer, not on the sub-ranges of the
ranged accessors.

Most of the accessor member functions which provide a reference to the
underlying buffer elements are affected by a ranged accessor's offset and
range.  For example, calling [code]#operator[](0)# on a one-dimensional ranged
accessor returns a reference to the element at the position specified by the
accessor's offset, which is not necessarily the first element in the buffer.
In addition, the accessor's iterator functions iterate only over the elements
that are within the sub-range.

The only exceptions are the [code]#get_pointer# and [code]#get_multi_ptr#
member functions, which return a pointer to the beginning of the underlying
buffer regardless of the accessor's offset.  Applications using these functions
must take care to manually add the offset before dereferencing the pointer
because accessing an element that is outside of the accessor's range results
in undefined behavior.

[NOTE]
====
There is no change in behavior for ranged accessors with a range of zero.
It still creates a requisite for the entire underlying buffer, and 
an attempt to access an element produces undefined behaviour.
====

==== Buffer accessor for commands

The [code]#accessor# class provides access to data in a [code]#buffer# from
within a <<sycl-kernel-function>> or from within a <<host-task>>.  When used in
a <<sycl-kernel-function>>, it accesses the contents of the buffer via the
device's <<global-memory>>.  These two forms of the accessor are distinguished
by the [code]#AccessTarget# template parameter as shown in
<<table.accessors.command.buffer.capabilities>>.  Both forms support the
following values for the [code]#AccessMode# template parameter:
[code]#access_mode::read#, [code]#access_mode::write# and
[code]#access_mode::read_write#.

[[table.accessors.command.buffer.capabilities]]
.Description of access targets for buffer accessors
[width="100%",options="header",cols="25%,75%"]
|====
| Access target | Meaning
| [code]#target::device#
    | Access a buffer from a <<sycl-kernel-function>> via device global memory.
| [code]#target::host_task#
    | Access a buffer from a <<host-task>>.
|====

Programs which specify the access target as [code]#target::device# and then use
the [code]#accessor# from a <<host-task>> are ill formed.  Likewise, programs
which specify the access target as [code]#target::host_task# and then use the
[code]#accessor# from a <<sycl-kernel-function>> are ill formed.

The dimensionality of the accessor must match the underlying buffer, however,
there is a special case if the buffer is one-dimensional.  In this case, the
accessor may either be one-dimensional or it may be zero-dimensional.  A
zero-dimensional accessor has access to just the first element of the buffer,
whereas a one-dimensional buffer has access to the entire buffer.

Certain [code]#accessor# constructors create a "placeholder" accessor.  Such
an accessor is bound to a [code]#buffer# and its semantics such as access
target and access mode are defined.  However, a placeholder accessor is not
yet bound to a <<command-group>>.  Before such an accessor can be used in a
<<command>>, it must be bound by calling [code]#handler::require()#.  If a
placeholder accessor is passed as an argument to a <<command>> without first
being bound to a <<command-group>> with [code]#handler::require()#, the
implementation throws a synchronous [code]#exception# with the
[code]#errc::kernel_argument# error code when the <<command>> is submitted.


===== Interface for buffer command accessors

A synopsis of the [code]#accessor# class is provided below, showing the
interface when it is specialized with [code]#target::device# or
[code]#target::host_task#.  Since some of the class types and member functions
have the same name and meaning as other accessors, the common types and
functions are described in <<sec:accessor.common.members>>.  The member types
are listed in <<table.accessors.common.types>> and
<<table.accessors.command.buffer.types>>.  The constructors are listed in
<<table.accessors.command.buffer.constructors>>, and the member functions are
listed in <<table.accessors.common.members>> and
<<table.accessors.command.buffer.members>>.

The additional common special member functions and common member functions are
listed in <<sec:reference-semantics>> in
<<table.specialmembers.common.reference>> and
<<table.hiddenfriends.common.reference>>, respectively.  For valid implicit
conversions between accessor types refer to
<<sec:accessor.command.buffer.conversions>>.  Additionally, accessors of the
same type must be equality comparable both in the host application and also in
<<sycl-kernel-function,SYCL kernel functions>>.

<<table.accessors.command.buffer.read-only>> shows the specializations of
[code]#accessor# with [code]#target::device# or
[code]#target::host_task# that are read-only accessors.  There is an implicit
conversion between any of these specializations, provided that all other
template parameters are the same.

===== Deprecated features of the [code]#accessor# class

All of the features defined in this section are deprecated and will likely be
removed from a future version of the specification.


====== Aliased names

The enumerated value [code]#target::global_buffer# is an alias for [code]#target:::device#.
It has the same type and value as its alias.

The enumerated type [code]#access::target# is an alias for [code]#target#, and
the enumerated type [code]#access::mode# is an alias for [code]#access_mode#.


====== Discard access modes

An [code]#accessor# instance specialized with access mode
[code]#access_mode::discard_write# has the same behavior as an [code]#accessor#
instance of mode [code]#access_mode::write# that is constructed with the
property [code]#property::no_init#.

An [code]#accessor# instance specialized with access mode
[code]#access_mode::discard_read_write# has the same behavior as an
[code]#accessor# instance of mode [code]#access_mode::read_write# that is
constructed with the property [code]#property::no_init#.


====== Placeholder template parameter

The [code]#accessor# template parameter [code]#IsPlaceholder# is allowed to be
specified, but it has no bearing on whether the [code]#accessor# instance is a
placeholder.  This is determined solely by the constructor used to create the
instance.

The associated type [code]#access::placeholder# is also deprecated.


====== Additional member functions for [code]#target::device# specialization

Specializations of the [code]#accessor# class with [code]#target::device# have
the additional member functions described in
<<table.accessors.deprecated.command.buffer.members>>.

====== Accessor specialization with [code]#target::constant_buffer#

The [code]#accessor# class may be specialized with target
[code]#target::constant_buffer#, which results in an accessor that can be used
within a <<sycl-kernel-function>> to access the contents of a buffer through
the device's <<constant-memory>>.

As with other [code]#accessor# specializations, the dimensionality must match
the underlying buffer, however there is a special case if the buffer is
one-dimensional.  In this case, the accessor may either be one-dimensional or
it may be zero-dimensional.  A zero-dimensional accessor has access to just the
first element of the buffer, whereas a one-dimensional buffer has access to the
entire buffer.

This specialization of [code]#accessor# is available only for the access mode
[code]#access_mode::read#.

This accessor type can be constructed as a "placeholder" accessor.  As with
other [code]#accessor# specializations that are placeholders,
[code]#handler::require()# must be called before passing a placeholder accessor
to a <<command>>.  If the application neglects to call
[code]#handler::require()# on a placeholder accessor, the implementation throws
a synchronous [code]#exception# with the [code]#errc::kernel_argument# error
code when the <<command>> is submitted.

A synopsis for this specialization of [code]#accessor# is provided below.
Since some of the class types and member functions have the same name and
meaning as other accessors, the common types and functions are described in
<<sec:accessor.deprecated.common.members>>.  The member types are listed in
<<table.accessors.deprecated.common.types>>.  The constructors are listed in
<<table.accessors.deprecated.constant.constructors>>, and the member functions
are listed in <<table.accessors.deprecated.common.members>> and
<<table.accessors.deprecated.constant.members>>.

The additional common special member functions and common member functions are
listed in <<sec:reference-semantics>> in
<<table.specialmembers.common.reference>> and
<<table.hiddenfriends.common.reference>>, respectively.  Additionally,
accessors of the same type must be equality comparable.

====== Accessor specialization with [code]#target::host_buffer#

The [code]#accessor# class may be specialized with target
[code]#target::host_buffer#, which results in a host accessor similar to
[code]#host_accessor#.  This specialization provides access to data in a
[code]#buffer# from host code that is outside of a <<command>>, and
constructors of this specialization block until the requested data is available
on the host.

As with other [code]#accessor# specializations, the dimensionality must match
the underlying buffer, however there is a special case if the buffer is
one-dimensional.  In this case, the accessor may either be one-dimensional or
it may be zero-dimensional.  A zero-dimensional accessor has access to just the
first element of the buffer, whereas a one-dimensional buffer has access to the
entire buffer.

This specialization of [code]#accessor# is available for all access modes
except for [code]#access_mode::atomic#.

A synopsis for this specialization of [code]#accessor# is provided below.
Since some of the class types and member functions have the same name and
meaning as other accessors, the common types and functions are described in
<<sec:accessor.deprecated.common.members>>.  The member types are listed in
<<table.accessors.deprecated.common.types>>.  The constructors are listed in
<<table.accessors.deprecated.host.constructors>>, and the member functions are
listed in <<table.accessors.deprecated.common.members>> and
<<table.accessors.deprecated.host.members>>.

The additional common special member functions and common member functions are
listed in <<sec:reference-semantics>> in
<<table.specialmembers.common.reference>> and
<<table.hiddenfriends.common.reference>>, respectively.  Additionally,
accessors of the same type must be equality comparable.

[code]#access_mode::read_write# and [code]#access_mode::atomic#.

If this is a <<ranged-accessor>>, the returned [code]#atomic# instance
provides access to the buffer element whose location is determined by adding
the accessor's offset to [code]#index#.

==== Buffer accessor for host code

The [code]#host_accessor# class provides access to data in a [code]#buffer#
from host code that is outside of a <<command>> (i.e. do not use this class to
access a buffer inside a host task).

As with [code]#accessor#, the dimensionality of [code]#host_accessor# must
match the underlying buffer, however, there is a special case if the buffer is
one-dimensional.  In this case, the accessor may either be one-dimensional or
it may be zero-dimensional.  A zero-dimensional accessor has access to just the
first element of the buffer, whereas a one-dimensional buffer has access to the
entire buffer.

The [code]#host_accessor# class supports the following access modes:
[code]#access_mode::read#, [code]#access_mode::write# and
[code]#access_mode::read_write#.


===== Interface for buffer host accessors

A synopsis of the [code]#host_accessor# class is provided below.  Since some of
the class types and member functions have the same name and meaning as other
accessors, the common types and functions are described in
<<sec:accessor.common.members>>.  The member types are listed in
<<table.accessors.common.types>>.
The constructors are listed in <<table.accessors.host.buffer.constructors>>,
and the member functions are listed in <<table.accessors.common.members>> and
<<table.accessors.host.buffer.members>>.

The additional common special member functions and common member functions are
listed in <<sec:reference-semantics>> in
<<table.specialmembers.common.reference>> and
<<table.hiddenfriends.common.reference>>, respectively.  For valid implicit
conversions between accessor types refer to
<<sec:accessor.host.buffer.conversions>>.  Additionally, accessors of the same
type must be equality comparable.

[[sec:accessor.local]]
==== Local accessor

The [code]#local_accessor# class allocates device local memory and provides
access to this memory from within a <<sycl-kernel-function>>.  The
<<local-memory>> that is allocated is shared between all
<<work-item,work items>> of a <<work-group>>.  If multiple work-groups execute
simultaneously in an implementation, each work-group receives its own
independent copy of the allocated local memory.

The underlying [code]#DataT# type can be any {cpp} type that the device
supports.  If [code]#DataT# is an implicit-lifetime type (as defined in the
{cpp} core language), the local accessor implicitly creates objects of that
type with indeterminate values.  For other types, the local accessor merely
allocates uninitialized memory, and the application is responsible for
constructing objects in that memory (e.g. by calling placement-new).

A local accessor must not be used in a <<sycl-kernel-function>> that is invoked
via [code]#single_task# or via the simple form of [code]#parallel_for# that
takes a [code]#range# parameter.  In these cases submitting the kernel to
a queue must throw a synchronous [code]#exception# with the
[code]#errc::kernel_argument# error code.


===== Interface for local accessors

A synopsis of the [code]#local_accessor# class is provided below.  Since some
of the class types and member functions have the same name and meaning as other

==== Unsampled image accessors

There are two classes which implement accessors for unsampled images,
[code]#unsampled_image_accessor# and [code]#host_unsampled_image_accessor#.
The former provides access from within a <<sycl-kernel-function>> or from
within a <<host-task>>.  The latter provides access from host code that is
outside of a <<host-task>>.

The dimensionality of an unsampled image accessor must match the dimensionality
of the underlying image to which it provides access.  Both unsampled image
accessor classes support the [code]#access_mode::read# and
[code]#access_mode::write# access modes.  In addition, the
[code]#host_unsampled_image_accessor# class supports
[code]#access_mode::read_write#.

The [code]#AccessTarget# template parameter dictates how the
[code]#unsampled_image_accessor# can be used: [code]#image_target::device#
means the accessor can be used in a <<sycl-kernel-function>> while
[code]#image_target::host_task# means the accessor can be used in a
<<host-task>>.  Programs which specify this template parameter as
[code]#image_target::device# and then use the [code]#unsampled_image_accessor#
from a <<host-task>> are ill formed.  Likewise, programs which specify this
template parameter as [code]#image_target::host_task# and then use the
[code]#unsampled_image_accessor# from a <<sycl-kernel-function>> are ill
formed.


===== Interface for unsampled image accessors

A synopsis of the two unsampled image accessor classes is provided below.  Both
classes have member types with the same name, which are described in

===== Read only unsampled image accessors and implicit conversions

All specializations of unsampled image accessors with [code]#access_mode::read#
are read-only regardless of whether [code]#DataT# is [code]#const# qualified.
There is an implicit conversion between the [code]#const# qualified and
non-[code]#const# qualified specializations, provided that all other template
parameters are the same.


==== Sampled image accessors

There are two classes which implement accessors for sampled images,
[code]#sampled_image_accessor# and [code]#host_sampled_image_accessor#.
The former provides access from within a <<sycl-kernel-function>> or from
within a <<host-task>>.  The latter provides access from host code that is
outside of a <<host-task>>.

The dimensionality of a sampled image accessor must match the dimensionality
of the underlying image to which it provides access.  Sampled image accessors
are always read-only.

The [code]#AccessTarget# template parameter dictates how the
[code]#sampled_image_accessor# can be used: [code]#image_target::device# means
the accessor can be used in a <<sycl-kernel-function>> while
[code]#image_target::host_task# means the accessor can be used in a
<<host-task>>.  Programs which specify this template parameter as
[code]#image_target::device# and then use the [code]#sampled_image_accessor#
from a <<host-task>> are ill formed.  Likewise, programs which specify this
template parameter as [code]#image_target::host_task# and then use the
[code]#sampled_image_accessor# from a <<sycl-kernel-function>> are ill formed.



===== Interface for sampled image accessors

A synopsis of the two sampled image accessor classes is provided below.  Both
classes have member types with the same name, which are described in
<<table.accessors.sampled.image.types>>.  The constructors for the two
classes are described in <<table.accessors.sampled.image.constructors>> and
<<table.accessors.host.sampled.image.constructors>>.  Both classes also have
member functions with the same name, which are described in
<<table.accessors.sampled.image.members>>.

The additional common special member functions and common member functions are
listed in <<sec:reference-semantics>> in
<<table.specialmembers.common.reference>> and
<<table.hiddenfriends.common.reference>>, respectively.  For valid implicit
conversions between sampled accessor types refer to
<<sec:accessor.sampled.image.conversions>>.

Two [code]#sampled_image_accessor# objects of the same type must be equality
comparable in both the host code and in SYCL kernel functions.  Two
[code]#host_sampled_image_accessor# objects of the same type must be equality
comparable in the host code.

=== Address space classes

In SYCL, there are five different address spaces: global, local, constant,
private and generic. In a SYCL generic implementation, types are not
affected by the address spaces. However, there are situations where users
need to explicitly carry address spaces in the type. For example:

  * For performance tuning and genericness. Even if the platform supports
    the representation of the generic address space, this may come at some
    performance sacrifice. In order to help the target compiler, it can be
    useful to track specifically which address space a pointer is
    addressing.
  * When linking SYCL kernels with <<backend>>-specific functions. In this
    case, it might be necessary to specify the address space for any pointer
    parameters.

Direct declaration of pointers with address spaces is discouraged as the
definition is implementation-defined. Users must rely on the
[code]#multi_ptr# class to handle address space boundaries and
interoperability.


[[sec:multiptr]]
==== Multi-pointer class

The multi-pointer class is the common interface for the explicit pointer
classes, defined in <<sec:pointerclasses>>.

There are situations where a user may want to make their type address space dependent.
This allows performing generic programming that depends on the address space associated
with their data. An example might be wrapping a pointer inside a class, where
a user may need to template the class according to the address space of the
pointer the class is initialized with. In this case, the [code]#multi_ptr#
class enables users to do this in a portable and stable way.

The [code]#multi_ptr# class exposes 3 flavors of the same interface.
If the value of [code]#access::decorated# is  [code]#access::decorated::no#,
the interface exposes pointers and references type that are not decorated by an address space.
If the value of [code]#access::decorated# is  [code]#access::decorated::yes#,
the interface exposes pointers and references type that are decorated by an address space.
The decoration is implementation dependent and relies on device compiler extensions.
The decorated type may be distinct from the non-decorated one.
For interoperability with the <<backend>>, users should rely on types exposed
by the decorated version.
If the value of [code]#access::decorated# is  [code]#access::decorated::legacy#,
the 1.2.1 interface is exposed.
This interface is deprecated.

The template traits [code]#remove_decoration# and type alias
[code]#remove_decoration_t# retrieve the non-decorated pointer or
reference from a decorated one.  Using this template trait with a
non-decorated type is safe and returns the same type.


It is possible to use the [code]#void# type for the [code]#multi_ptr#
class, but in that case some functionality is disabled.
[code]#multi_ptr<void># does not provide the [code]#reference# or
[code]#const_reference# types, the access operators
([code]#operator*()#, [code]#+operator->()+#), the arithmetic
operators or [code]#prefetch# member function.
Conversions from [code]#multi_ptr# to [code]#multi_ptr<void># of the
same address space are allowed, and will occur implicitly.
Conversions from [code]#multi_ptr<void># to any other
[code]#multi_ptr# type of the same address space
are allowed, but must be explicit.
The same rules apply to [code]#multi_ptr<const void>#.

An overview of the interface provided for the [code]#multi_ptr# class
follows.

The following is the overview of the legacy interface from 1.2.1 provided
for the [code]#multi_ptr# class.

This legacy class supports the deprecated [code]#address_space::constant_space#
address space, which can be used to represent a pointer to <<constant-memory>>.
Pointers to <<constant-memory>> have an implementation-defined address space,
and each implementation can define whether it is legal to assign such a pointer
to a generic address pointer.

== Unified shared memory (USM)

This section describes properties and routines for pointer-based
memory management interfaces in SYCL.  These routines augment, rather
than replace, the buffer-based interfaces in SYCL.

Unified Shared Memory (<<usm>>) provides a pointer-based alternative to
the buffer programming model. USM enables:

  * Easier integration into existing code bases by representing allocations
    as pointers rather than buffers, with full support for pointer
    arithmetic into allocations.
  * Fine-grain control over ownership and accessibility of allocations, to
    optimally choose between performance and programmer convenience.
  * A simpler programming model, by automatically migrating some allocations
    between SYCL devices and the host.

To show the differences with example from <<sec:anatomy>>, the
following source code example shows how shared memory can be used
between host and device:

[source,,linenums]
----
include::{code_dir}/usm_shared.cpp[lines=4..-1]
----

By comparison, the following source code example uses less capable
device memory, which requires explicit copy between the device and the
host:
[source,,linenums]
----
include::{code_dir}/usm_device.cpp[lines=4..-1]
----


=== Unified addressing

Unified Addressing guarantees that all devices will use a unified address
space. Pointer values in the unified address space will always refer to the
same location in memory. The unified address space encompasses the host and
one or more devices. Note that this does not require addresses in the
unified address space to be accessible on all devices, just that pointer
values will be consistent.


=== Kinds of unified shared memory

<<usm>> is a capability that, when available, provides the ability
to create allocations that are visible to both host and device(s).
USM builds upon Unified Addressing to define a shared address space
where pointer values in this space always refer to the same location
in memory.  USM defines three types of memory allocations 
described in <<table.USM.allocation>>.

[[table.USM.allocation]]
.Type of USM allocations
[width="100%",options="header",cols="20%,80%"]
|====
| USM allocation type | Description
| [code]#host#
    | Allocations in host memory that are accessible by a device
| [code]#device#
    | Allocations in device memory that are *not* accessible by the host
| [code]#shared#
    | Allocations in shared memory that are accessible by both host and
      device
|====

The following [code]#enum# is used to refer to the different types of allocations
inside of a SYCL program:

[source,,linenums]
----
namespace sycl {
  namespace usm {
    enum class alloc {
      host,
      device,
      shared,
      unknown
    };
  }
}
----

USM is an optional feature which may not be supported by all devices, and
devices that support USM may not support all types of USM allocation. A SYCL
application can use the [code]#device::has()# function to determine the
level of USM support for a device. See <<table.device.aspect>> in
<<sec:device-aspects>> for more details.

The characteristics of USM allocations are summarized in
<<table.USM.allocation.characteristics>>.

|====

USM allocations are only guaranteed to be valid in the SYCL context in which
they were created. The behavior of accessing a USM allocation in a different
context from which it was created is undefined.  Attempting to access a kind
of USM allocation that is not supported by the device results in undefined
behavior.

Device allocations are used for explicitly managing device memory.
Programmers directly allocate device memory and explicitly copy data
between host memory and a device allocation. Device allocations are obtained
through SYCL USM device allocation routines instead of system allocation
routines like [code]#std::malloc# or {cpp} [code]#new#. Device
allocations are not accessible on the host, but the pointer values remain
consistent on account of Unified Addressing.  The size of device allocations
will be limited by the amount of memory in a device.  Support for device
allocations on a specific device can be queried through
[code]#aspect::usm_device_allocations#.

Device allocations must be explicitly copied between the host and a device.
The member functions to copy and initialize data are found in
<<table.members.queue>> and <<table.members.handler.copy>>, and these
functions may be used on device allocations if a device supports
[code]#aspect::usm_device_allocations#.

Host allocations allow devices to directly read and write host memory
inside of a kernel.  This can be useful for several reasons, such as when the
overhead of moving a small amount of data is not worth paying over the cost of a
remote access or when the size of a data set exceeds the size of a device's memory.
Host allocations must also be obtained using SYCL routines instead
of system allocation routines. While a device may remotely read and
write a host allocation, the allocation does not migrate to the device -
it remains in host memory.  Users should take care to properly synchronize
access to host allocations between host execution and kernels. The total
size of host allocations will be limited by the amount of pinnable-memory
on the host on most systems. Support for host allocations on a specific
device can be queried through [code]#aspect::usm_host_allocations#.
Support for atomic modification of host allocations
on a specific device can be queried through
[code]#aspect::usm_atomic_host_allocations#.

Shared allocations implicitly share data between the host
and devices. Data may move to where it is being used without the programmer
explicitly informing the runtime.  It is up to the runtime and backends
to make sure that a shared allocation is available where it is used.
Shared allocations must also be obtained using SYCL allocation routines
instead of the system allocator.  The maximum size of a shared allocation
on a specific device, and the total size of all shared allocations in a
context, are implementation-defined.
Support for shared allocations on a
specific device can be queried through [code]#aspect::usm_shared_allocations#.

Not all devices may support concurrent access of a shared allocation
with the host.  If a device does not support this,
host execution and device code must take turns accessing the allocation, so
the host must not access a shared allocation while a kernel is executing.
Host access to a shared allocation which is also accessed
by an executing kernel on a device that does not support
concurrent access results in undefined behavior.  If a device does
support concurrent access, both the host and and the device may atomically
modify the same data inside an allocation. Allocations, or pieces of allocations,
are now free to migrate to different devices in the same context
that also support this capability.  Additionally, many devices that support
concurrent access may support a working set of shared allocations
larger than device memory.  
Users may query whether a device supports concurrent access with atomic
modification of shared allocations through the aspect
[code]#aspect::usm_atomic_shared_allocations#.
See <<table.device.aspect>> in <<sec:device-aspects>> for more details.

Performance hints for shared allocations may be specified by the user
by enqueueing [code]#prefetch# operations on a device.  These operations
inform the SYCL runtime that the specified shared allocation is
likely to be accessed on the device in the future, and that it is free
to migrate the allocation to the device. 
More about [code]#prefetch# is found in <<table.members.queue>> and
<<table.members.handler.copy>>.  If a device supports concurrent access to
shared allocations, then [code]#prefetch# operations may be overlapped
with kernel execution.

Additionally, users may use the [code]#mem_advise# member function to annotate
shared allocations with [code]#advice#.  Valid [code]#advice# is defined by the
device and its associated backend.  See <<table.members.queue>> and
<<table.members.handler.copy>> for more information.

In the most capable systems, users do not need to use SYCL USM allocation functions
to create shared allocations. The system allocator ([code]#malloc#/[code]#new#) may
instead be used. Likewise, [code]#std::free# and
[code]#delete# are used instead of [code]#sycl::free#. Note that
host and device allocations are unaffected by this
change and must still be allocated using their respective USM functions in
order to guarantee their behavior.  Users may query the device to determine
if system allocations are supported for use on the device, through
[code]#aspect::usm_system_allocations#.



=== USM allocations

USM provides several allocation functions.  These functions accept a [code]#property_list# parameter, which is provided for future extensibility.  This specification does not yet define any USM allocation properties.

==== {cpp} allocator interface

USM provides an allocator class that aligns with the {cpp} allocator interface.  This is useful when
using USM with things like {cpp} containers or routines like [code]#std::allocate_shared#.  However, due
to how {cpp} library routines that use allocators tend to assume that any memory allocated by an allocator
may be accessed on the host, the [code]#usm_allocator# class is not required to support
allocating [code]#usm::alloc::device# allocations.

[source,,linenums]
----

                         const usm_allocator<U, AllocKindU, AlignmentU> &);
};
----

While the modern {cpp} [code]#usm_allocator# interface is sufficient for
specifying USM allocations and deallocations, many programmers may prefer
C-style [code]#malloc-influenced# APIs. As a convenience to
programmers, [code]#malloc-style# APIs are also defined. Additionally,
other utility functions are specified in the following sections to perform
various operations such as memory copies and initializations as well as to
provide performance hints.

If the user attempts to allocate a kind of USM allocation on a device that does
not support it, the allocation functions will throw a synchronous [code]#exception# with the
[code]#errc::feature_not_supported# error code.

==== Parameterized allocation functions

Device aspects define the set of legal allocation [code]#kind# in the
parameterized allocation functions that follow.  [code]#usm:alloc::host#
allocations require a device to have [code]#aspect::usm_host_allocations#.
[code]#usm:alloc::device# allocations require a device to have

[code]#usm:alloc::shared# allocations require a device to have

on a device that doesn't have the appropriate aspect results in
the allocation function throwing a synchronous [code]#exception#
with the [code]#errc::feature_not_supported# error code, or 
undefined behavior in the case of use of a host allocation on

=== Unified shared memory pointer queries

Since USM pointers look like raw {cpp} pointers, users cannot deduce what kind of
USM allocation a given pointer may be from examining its type.  However, two
functions are defined that let users query the type of a USM allocation and, if
applicable, the [code]#device# on which it was allocated.  These query functions
are only supported on the host.

[[sec:expr-parall-thro]]
== Expressing parallelism through kernels


[[ranges-identifiers]]
=== Ranges and index space identifiers

The data parallelism of the SYCL kernel execution model requires
instantiation of a parallel execution over a
range of iteration space coordinates. To achieve this, SYCL exposes types
to define the range of execution and to identify a given execution
instance's point in the iteration space.

The following types are defined: [code]#range#,
[code]#nd_range#, [code]#id#, [code]#item#, [code]#h_item#,
[code]#nd_item# and [code]#group#.

When constructing multi-dimensional ids or ranges from integers, the elements
are written such that the right-most element varies fastest in a linearization
of the multi-dimensional space (see <<sec:multi-dim-linearization>>).

executing at each point in a [code]#range#. It is passed to a
[code]#parallel_for# call or returned by member functions of [code]#h_item#.
It encapsulates enough information to identify the work-item's range
of possible values and its ID in that range. It can optionally carry the offset of the
range if provided to the [code]#parallel_for#; note this is deprecated in SYCL 2020.
Instances of the [code]#item# class are
not user-constructible and are passed by the runtime to each instance
of the function object.

The SYCL [code]#item# class template provides the common by-value semantics
(see <<sec:byval-semantics>>).

A synopsis of the SYCL [code]#item# class is provided below. The member
functions of the SYCL [code]#item# class are listed in
<<table.members.id>>. The additional common special member functions
and common member functions are listed in <<sec:byval-semantics>> in
<<table.specialmembers.common.byval>> and
<<table.hiddenfriends.common.byval>> respectively.

[[group-class]]
==== [code]#group# class

The [code]#group<int Dimensions># encapsulates all functionality
required to represent a particular <<work-group>> within a
parallel execution. It is not user-constructible.

The local range stored in the group class is provided either by
the programmer, when it is passed as an optional parameter to
[code]#parallel_for_work_group#, or by the runtime system when it
selects the optimal work-group size. This allows the developer to
always know how many concurrent work-items are active in each
executing work-group, even through the abstracted iteration range of the
[code]#parallel_for_work_item# loops.

The SYCL [code]#group# class template provides the common by-value
semantics (see <<sec:byval-semantics>>).

A synopsis of the SYCL [code]#group# class is provided below. The
member functions of the SYCL [code]#group# class are listed in
<<table.members.group>>. The additional common special member
functions and common member functions are listed in

[[sec:reduction]]
=== Reduction variables

All functionality related to <<reduction,reductions>> is captured by the
[code]#reducer# class and the [code]#reduction# function.

The example below demonstrates how to write a <<reduction>>
kernel that performs two reductions simultaneously on the same input values,
computing both the sum of all values in a buffer and the maximum value in the
buffer.  For each reduction variable passed to [code]#parallel_for#, a
reference to a [code]#reducer# object is passed as a parameter to the kernel
function in the same order.

[source,,linenums]
----
include::{code_dir}/reduction.cpp[lines=4..-1]
----

Reductions are supported for all trivially copyable types (as defined by the
{cpp} core language).  If the reduction operator is non-associative or
non-commutative, the behavior of a reduction may be non-deterministic. If
multiple reductions reference the same reduction variable, or a reduction
variable is accessed directly during the lifetime of a reduction (e.g. via an
[code]#accessor# or USM pointer), the behavior is undefined.

Certain implementations of reductions can be made more efficient if the
reduction operator has an identity value and this value is known to the
implementation. For standard binary operators (e.g. [code]#plus# on arithmetic
types), an implementation can determine the correct identity value
automatically in order to avoid performance penalties.

If an implementation can identify an identity value for a given combination of
accumulator type and function object type, the value is defined as a member of
the [code]#known_identity# trait class.  Whether this member value exists can
be tested using the [code]#has_known_identity# trait class.

[source,,linenums]
----
include::{header_dir}/identity.h[lines=4..-1]
----

The reduction interface is limited to reduction variables whose size can be
determined at compile-time.  As such, [code]#buffer# and USM pointer arguments
are interpreted by the reduction interface as describing a single variable.
A reduction operation associated with a [code]#span# represents an array
reduction.  An array reduction of size _N_ is functionally equivalent to
specifying _N_ independent scalar reductions.  The combination operations
performed by an array reduction are limited to the extent of a USM allocation
described by a [code]#span#, and access to elements outside of these regions
results in undefined behavior.

[NOTE]
====
Since a [code]#span# is one-dimensional, there is currently no way to describe
an array reduction with more than one dimension.  This is expected to change in
a future version of the SYCL specification, but depends on the introduction of
a multi-dimensional [code]#span#.
====

[[reduction-interface]]
==== [code]#reduction# interface

The [code]#reduction# interface is used to attach <<reduction>> semantics
to a variable, by specifying: the reduction variable, the
reduction operator and an optional identity value associated with the operator.
The overloads of the interface are described in <<table.reduction>>.
The return value of the [code]#reduction# interface is an
implementation-defined object of unspecified type, which is interpreted by
[code]#parallel_for# to construct an appropriate [code]#reducer#
type as detailed in <<reducer-class>>.

An implementation may use an unspecified number of temporary variables inside
of any [code]#reducer# objects it creates. If an identity value is supplied to
a reduction, an implementation will use that value to initialize any such
temporary variables.

[NOTE]
====
Since the number of temporary variables is unspecified, supplying an identity
value different to the identity value associated with the reduction operator
may lead to unexpected results.
====

The initial value of the reduction variable is included
in the reduction operation, unless the [code]#property::reduction::initialize_to_identity#
property was specified when the [code]#reduction# interface was invoked.

The reduction variable
is updated so as to contain the result of the reduction when the kernel finishes
execution.

[[reducer-class]]
==== [code]#reducer# class

The [code]#reducer# class defines the interface between a work-item and a
reduction variable during the execution of a SYCL kernel, restricting access to
the underlying reduction variable.  The intermediate values of a reduction
variable cannot be inspected during kernel execution, and the variable cannot
be updated using anything other than the reduction's specified combination
operation.  The combination order of different reducers is unspecified, as are
when and how the value of each reducer is combined with the original reduction
variable.

To enable compile-time specialization of reduction algorithms, the
implementation of the [code]#reducer# class is unspecified,
except for the functions and operators defined in <<table.members.reducer>>
and <<table.operators.reducer>>.  As such, developers should not specify the
template arguments of a [code]#reducer# directly, and should instead employ
generic programming techniques that allow kernel functions to accept a
reference to a variable of any [code]#reducer# type.  Kernels written as
lambdas should employ [code]#auto&# or [code]#+auto&...+#, and kernels written as
function objects should employ template parameters or template parameter packs.

An implementation must guarantee that it is safe for each concurrently
executing work-item in a kernel to call the combine function of a
[code]#reducer# in parallel. An implementation is free to re-use reducer
variables (e.g. across work-groups scheduled to the same compute unit) if it
can guarantee that it is safe to do so.

The member functions of the [code]#reducer# class are listed in
<<table.members.reducer>>.  Additional shorthand operators may be made
available for certain combinations of reduction variable type and combination
operation, as described in <<table.operators.reducer>>.

[[sec:command.group.scope]]
=== Command group scope

A <<command-group-scope>>, as defined in <<sec:executionmodel>>,
may execute a single <<command>> such as invoking a kernel, copying memory,
or executing a host task.  It is legal for a <<command-group-scope>> to
statically contain more than one call to a <<command>> function, but any
single execution of the <<command-group-function-object>> may execute no more
than one <<command>>.  The statements that call <<command, commands>> together with
the statements that define the requirements for a kernel form the
<<command-group-function-object>>.  The command group
function object takes as a parameter an instance of the <<handler>> class which
encapsulates all the member functions executed in the command group scope.
The member functions and objects defined in this scope will define the requirements for the
kernel execution or explicit memory operation, and will be used by the <<sycl-runtime>>
to evaluate if the operation is ready for execution.
Host code within a <<command-group-function-object>> (typically setting up
requirements) is executed once, before the command group submit call returns.
This abstraction of the kernel
execution unifies the data with its processing, and consequently allows more
abstraction and flexibility in the parallel programming models that can be
implemented on top of SYCL.

The <<command-group-function-object>> and the [code]#handler# class
serve as an interface for the encapsulation of <<command-group-scope>>.
A <<sycl-kernel-function>> is defined as a function object. All the device data accesses are
defined inside this group and any transfers are managed by the <<sycl-runtime>>. The
rules for the data transfers regarding device and
host data accesses are better described in <<sec:data.access.and.storage>>,
where buffers (<<subsec:buffers>>) and accessor (<<subsec:accessors>>) classes
are described.  The overall memory model of the SYCL application is described in
<<sub.section.memmodel.app>>.

It is possible to obtain events for the start of the <<command-group-function-object>>,
the kernel starting, and the command group completing.
These events are useful for
profiling and synchronization of kernels.
When using buffers, safe synchronization in SYCL requires synchronization on
buffer availability, not on kernel completion. This is because
the memory that data is stored in upon kernel
completion is not rigidly specified. The events are provided at the submission of the
<<command-group-function-object>> to the queue to be executed on.

It is possible for a <<command-group-function-object>> to fail to enqueue to a queue,
or for it to fail to execute correctly. A user can therefore supply a secondary
queue when submitting a command group to the primary queue. If the <<sycl-runtime>>
fails to enqueue or execute a command group on a primary queue, it can attempt
to run the command group on the secondary queue. The circumstances in which it
is, or is not, possible for a <<sycl-runtime>> to fall-back from primary to
secondary queue are unspecified in the specification.  Even if a command group
is run on the secondary queue, the requirement that host code within the command group
is executed exactly once remains, regardless of whether the fallback queue is used for
execution.

The command group [code]#handler# class provides the interface
for all of the member functions that are able to be executed inside the command group
scope, and it is also provided as a scoped object to all of the data access
requests. The <<handler>> class provides the interface
in which every command in the command group scope will be submitted to a queue.


[[sec:handlerClass]]
=== Command group [code]#handler# class

A <<handler>> object can only be constructed by the SYCL
runtime. All of the accessors defined in <<command-group-scope>> take as a
parameter an instance of the <<handler>>, and all the
kernel invocation functions are member functions of this class.

The constructors of the SYCL [code]#handler# class are described in
<<table.constructors.handler>>.

It is disallowed for an instance of the SYCL [code]#handler# class to
be moved or copied.

implicitly added to the <<command-group>> for the accessor's data.  However,
this does not happen when creating a [keyword]#placeholder# accessor.  In order
to create a *requirement* for a [keyword]#placeholder# accessor, code
must call the [code]#handler::require()# member function.

SYCL events may also be used to create requirements for a <<command-group>>.
Such requirements state that the actions represented by the events must
complete before the <<command-group>> may execute.  Such requirements
are added when code calls the [code]#handler::depends_on()# member function.

// Interface for apis
// include headers/parallelFor.h ?


===== [code]#single_task# invoke

SYCL provides a simple interface to enqueue a kernel that will be
sequentially executed on a device. Only one instance of the
kernel will be executed. This interface is useful as a primitive for more
complicated parallel algorithms, as it can easily create a chain of
sequential tasks on a SYCL device with each of them managing its
own data transfers.

This function can only be called inside a command group using the
[code]#handler# object created by the runtime.
Any accessors that are used in a kernel should be defined inside the
same command group.

Local accessors are disallowed for single task invocations.

[source,,linenums]
----
include::{code_dir}/singletask.cpp[lines=4..-1]
----

For single tasks, the kernel member function takes no parameters, as there
is no need for <<index-space-classes>> in a unary index space.

A [code]#kernel_handler# can optionally be passed as a parameter
to the <<sycl-kernel-function>> that is invoked by
[code]#single_task# for the purpose explained
in <<sec:spec-constants.device-code>>.

[source,,linenums]

include::{code_dir}/singleTaskWithKernelHandler.cpp[lines=4..-1]

===== [code]#parallel_for# invoke

The [code]#parallel_for# member function of the SYCL
[code]#handler# class provides an interface to define and invoke a SYCL
kernel function in a command group, to execute in parallel execution over a
3 dimensional index space. There are three overloads of the
[code]#parallel_for# member function which provide variations of this
interface, each with a different level of complexity and providing a
different set of features.

For the simplest case, users need only provide the global range (the total
number of work-items in the index space) via a SYCL [code]#range#
parameter. In this case the function object that represents the SYCL kernel
function must take one of:
1) a single SYCL [code]#item# parameter, 2) single generic parameter
([code]#template# parameter or [code]#auto)#, 3) any other type
implicitly converted from SYCL [code]#item#, representing the currently
executing work-item within the range specified by the [code]#range#
parameter.

The execution of the kernel function is the same whether the parameter to
the SYCL kernel function is a SYCL [code]#id# or a SYCL
[code]#item#. What differs is the functionality that is available to
the SYCL kernel function via the respective interfaces.

Below is an example of invoking a SYCL kernel function with
[code]#parallel_for# using a lambda function, and passing a SYCL
[code]#id# parameter. In this case, only the global id is available.
This variant of [code]#parallel_for# is designed for when it is not
necessary to query the global range of the index space being executed across.

being executed across.

achieved using class with templatized [code]#operator()#. This variant
of [code]#parallel_for# is designed for when it is necessary to query
the global range within which the global id will vary.

[source,,linenums]
----
include::{code_dir}/basicParallelForGeneric.cpp[lines=4..-1]
----

Below is an example of invoking a SYCL kernel function with
[code]#parallel_for# using a lambda function and passing integral type

this case only the global id is available. This variant of
[code]#parallel_for# is designed for when it is not necessary to query
the global range of the index space being executed across.

[source,,linenums]
----
include::{code_dir}/basicParallelForIntegral.cpp[lines=4..-1]
----

The [code]#parallel_for# overload without an offset can be called with
either a number or a [code]#braced-init-list# with 1-3 elements. In that
case the following calls are equivalent:

  * [code]#parallel_for(N, some_kernel)# has same effect as
    [code]#parallel_for(range<1>(N), some_kernel)#
  * [code]#parallel_for({N}, some_kernel)# has same effect as
    [code]#parallel_for(range<1>(N), some_kernel)#
  * [code]#parallel_for({N1, N2}, some_kernel)# has same effect as
    [code]#parallel_for(range<2>(N1, N2), some_kernel)#
  * [code]#parallel_for({N1, N2, N3}, some_kernel)# has same effect
    as [code]#parallel_for(range<3>(N1, N2, N3), some_kernel)#

Below is an example of invoking [code]#parallel_for# with a number
instead of an explicit [code]#range# object.

[source,,linenums]
----
include::{code_dir}/basicParallelForNumber.cpp[lines=4..-1]
----

For SYCL kernel functions invoked via the above described overload of the
[code]#parallel_for# member function, it is disallowed to use local
accessors or to use a <<work-group-barrier>>.

The following two examples show how a kernel function object can be launched
over a 3D grid, with 3 elements in each dimension. In the first case
work-item ids range from 0 to 2 inclusive, and in the second case
work-item ids run from 1 to 3.

[source,,linenums]
----
include::{code_dir}/parallelfor.cpp[lines=4..-1]
----

The last case of a [code]#parallel_for# invocation enables low-level functionality
of work-items and work-groups. This becomes valuable when an execution
requires groups of work-items that communicate and synchronize. These are
exposed in SYCL through [code]#+parallel_for (nd_range,...)+# and the
[code]#nd_item# class. In this case, the developer needs to define the
[code]#nd_range# that the kernel will execute on in order to have fine
grained control of the enqueuing of the kernel. This variation of
parallel_for expects an [code]#nd_range#, specifying both local and
global ranges, defining the global number of work-items and the number in
each cooperating work-group. The resulting function object is passed an
[code]#nd_item# instance making all the information available, as well
as <<work-group-barrier>> to synchronize between the <<work-item>>s in
the <<work-group>>.

The following example shows how sixty-four work-items may be launched
in a three-dimensional grid with four in each dimension, and divided
into eight work-groups. Each group of work-items synchronizes with a
<<work-group-barrier>>.

[source,,linenums]
----
include::{code_dir}/parallelforbarrier.cpp[lines=4..-1]
----

In all of these cases the underlying <<nd-range>> will be created
and the kernel defined as a function object will be created and enqueued
as part of the command group scope.

Some forms of [code]#parallel_for# accept an offset parameter of type
[code]#id<Dimensions>#, where the number of dimensions of the [code]#id# is the same
as the number of dimensions of the [code]#range# that determines the iteration space.
These forms of [code]#parallel_for# execute the same number of iterations as the form
with no offset.  The difference is that the [code]#id# or [code]#item# parameter passed
to the kernel function has the value of [code]#offset# implicitly added.
This offset parameter is deprecated in SYCL 2020.

An offset can also be passed to the forms of [code]#parallel_for# that accept an
[code]#nd_range# via the third parameter to the [code]#nd_range# constructor.  These
forms of [code]#parallel_for# also execute the same number of iterations as if no offset
was specified.  The difference is that the [code]#nd_item# parameter passed to the kernel
function has the value of the offset implicitly added to the constituent <<global-id>>.
This offset parameter is deprecated in SYCL 2020.


A [code]#kernel_handler# can optionally be passed as a parameter to the
<<sycl-kernel-function>> that is invoked by both variants of
[code]#parallel_for#.

===== Parallel for hierarchical invoke

The hierarchical parallel kernel execution interface provides the same
functionality as is available from the <<nd-range>> interface, but
exposed differently. To execute the same sixty-four work-items in
sixteen work-groups that we saw in the previous example, we execute an
outer [code]#parallel_for_work_group# call to create the
groups. The member function
[code]#handler::parallel_for_work_group# is parameterized by the
number of work-groups, such that the size of each group is chosen by
the runtime, or by the number of work-groups and number of work-items
for users who need more control.

The body of the outer [code]#parallel_for_work_group# call
consists of a lambda function or function object. The body of this
function object contains code that is executed only once for the
entire work-group. If the code has no side-effects and the compiler
heuristic suggests that it is more efficient to do so, this code will be
executed for each work-item.

Within this region any variable declared will have the semantics of
<<local-memory>>, shared between all <<work-item,work items>> in the
<<work-group>>. If the
device compiler can prove that an array of such variables is accessed only by
a single work-item throughout the lifetime of the work-group, for
example if access is derived from the id of the work-item with no
transformation, then it can allocate the data in private memory or
registers instead.

To guarantee use of private per-work-item memory, the
[code]#private_memory# class can be used to wrap the data.
This class simply constructs private data for a given group across the
entire group. The id of the current work-item is passed to any access
to grab the correct data.

The [code]#private_memory# class has the following interface:

<<private-memory,Private memory>> is allocated per underlying <<work-item>>, not per
iteration of the [code]#parallel_for_work_item# loop. The number
of instances of a private memory object is only under direct control
if a work-group size is passed to the
[code]#parallel_for_work_group# call. If the underlying
work-group size is chosen by the runtime, the number of private memory
instances is opaque to the program. Explicit private memory
declarations should therefore be used with care and with a full
understanding of which instances of a
[code]#parallel_for_work_item# loop will share the same
underlying variable.

Also within the lambda body can be a sequence of calls to
[code]#parallel_for_work_item#. At the edges of these inner parallel
executions the work-group synchronizes. As a result the pair of
[code]#parallel_for_work_item# calls in the code below is equivalent to
the parallel execution with a <<work-group-barrier>> in the earlier
example.

[source,,linenums]
----
include::{code_dir}/parallelforworkgroup.cpp[lines=4..-1]
----

It is valid to use more flexible dimensions of the work-item loops. In
the following example we issue 8 work-groups but let the runtime
choose their size, by not passing a work-group size to the
[code]#parallel_for_work_group# call. The
[code]#parallel_for_work_item# loops may also vary in size, with
their execution ranges unrelated to the dimensions of the work-group,
and the compiler generating an appropriate iteration space to fill the
gap. In this case, the [code]#h_item# provides access to local ids and
ranges that reflect both kernel and [code]#parallel_for_work_item# invocation ranges.

[source,,linenums]
----
include::{code_dir}/parallelforworkgroup2.cpp[lines=4..-1]
----

This interface offers a more intuitive way for tiling parallel
programming paradigms. In summary, the hierarchical model allows a
developer to distinguish the execution at work-group level and at
work-item level using the [code]#parallel_for_work_group# and the nested
[code]#parallel_for_work_item# functions. It also provides this visibility
to the compiler without the need for difficult loop fission such that
host execution may be more efficient.

A [code]#kernel_handler# can optionally be passed as a parameter to the
<<sycl-kernel-function>> that is invoked by any variant of
[code]#parallel_for_work_group#.

[[subsec:explicitmemory]]
==== SYCL functions for explicit memory operations

In addition to <<kernel,kernels>>, <<command-group>> objects can also be used to
perform manual operations on host and device memory by using the
[keyword]#copy# API of the <<handler>>.
Manual copy operations can be seen as specialized kernels executing on the
device, except that typically this operations will be implemented using a
host API that exists as part of a backend (e.g, OpenCL enqueue copy operations).

These explicit copy operations have a source and a destination.  When an
accessor is the _source_ of the operation, the destination can be a host
pointer or another accessor.  The _source_ accessor must have either
[code]#access_mode::read# or [code]#access_mode::read_write# access mode.  When
an accessor is the _destination_ of the explicit copy operation, the source can
be a host pointer or another accessor.  The _destination_ accessor must have
either [code]#access_mode::write#, [code]#access_mode::read_write#,
[code]#access_mode::discard_write# or [code]#access_mode::discard_read_write#
access mode.

When an accessor is used as a parameter to one of these explicit copy
operations, the target must be either [code]#target::device# or
[code]#target::constant_buffer#.

When accessors are both the origin and the destination,
the operation is executed on objects controlled by the SYCL runtime.
The SYCL runtime is allowed to not perform an explicit in-copy operation
if a different path to update the data is available according to
the SYCL application memory model.

The most recent copy of the memory object may reside on any context controlled
by the SYCL runtime, or on the host in a pointer controlled by the
SYCL runtime.  The SYCL runtime will ensure that data is copied to the destination
once the <<command-group>> has completed execution.

Whenever a host pointer is used as either the host or the destination of these
explicit memory operations, it is the responsibility
of the user for that pointer to have at least as much memory allocated as
the accessor is giving access to, e.g: if an accessor accesses a range
of 10 elements of [code]#int# type, the host pointer must at least have
[code]#10 * sizeof(int)# bytes of memory allocated.

A special case is the [code]#update_host# member function.
This member function only requires an accessor, and instructs the runtime to update
the internal copy of the data in the host, if any. This is particularly
useful when users use manual synchronization with host pointers, e.g.
via mutex objects on the [code]#buffer# constructors.

<<table.members.handler.copy>> describes the interface for the
explicit copy operations.

[[sec:handler.usekernelbundle]]
==== Functions for using a kernel bundle

[source,,linenums]
----
include::{header_dir}/handler/useKernelBundle.h[lines=4..-1]
----

_Effects:_ The <<command-group>> associated with the [code]#handler# will use
<<device-image,device images>> of the [code]#kernel_bundle# [code]#execBundle#
in any of its <<kernel-invocation-command,kernel invocation commands>>.  If the
[code]#kernel_bundle# contains multiple <<device-image,device images>> that are
compatible with the <<device>> to which the kernel is submitted, then the
<<device-image>> chosen is implementation-defined.

If the <<command-group>> attempts to invoke a kernel that is not contained by
a compatible device image in [code]#execBundle#, the
<<kernel-invocation-command>> throws a synchronous [code]#exception# with the
[code]#errc::kernel_not_supported# error code.  If the <<command-group>> has a
secondary queue, then the [code]#execBundle# must contain a kernel that is
compatible with both the primary queue's device and the secondary queue's
device, otherwise the <<kernel-invocation-command>> throws this exception.

Since the handler method for setting specialization constants is incompatible
with the kernel bundle method, applications should not call this function if
[code]#handler::set_specialization_constant()# has been previously called for
this same <<command-group>>.

_Throws:_

  * An [code]#exception# with the [code]#errc::invalid# error code if the
    <<context>> associated with the <<handler>> via its associated primary
    <<queue>> or the <<context>> associated with the secondary <<queue>> (if
    provided) is different from the <<context>> associated with the
    <<kernel-bundle>> specified by [code]#execBundle#.

  * An [code]#exception# with the [code]#errc::invalid# error code if
    [code]#handler::set_specialization_constant()# has been called for this
    <<command-group>>.


=== Specialization constants

Device code can make use of <<specialization-constant,specialization constants>>
which represent constants whose values can be set dynamically during execution
of the <<sycl-application>>.  The values of these constants are fixed when a
<<sycl-kernel-function>> is invoked, and they do not change during the
execution of the kernel.  However, the application is able to set a new value
for a specialization constant each time a kernel is invoked, so the values can
be tuned differently for each invocation.

There are two methods for an application to use specialization constants, one
method requires creating a [code]#kernel_bundle# object and the other does not.
The syntax for both methods is mostly the same.  Both methods declare
specialization constants in the same way, and kernels read their values in the
same way.  The main difference is whether their values are set via
[code]#handler::set_specialization_constant()# or via
[code]#kernel_bundle::set_specialization_constant()#.  These two methods are
incompatible with one another, so they may not both be used by the same
<<command-group>>.

[NOTE]
====
Implementations that support online compilation of kernel bundles will likely
implement both methods of specialization constants using kernel bundles.
Therefore, applications should expect that there is some overhead associated
with invoking a kernel with new values for its specialization constants.  A
typical implementation records the values of specialization constants set via
[code]#handler::set_specialization_constant()# and remembers these values until
a kernel is invoked (e.g. via [code]#parallel_for()#).  At this point, the
implementation determines the bundle that contains the invoked kernel.  If
that bundle has already been compiled for the handler's device and compiled
with the correct values for the specialization constants, the kernel is
scheduled for invocation.  Otherwise, the implementation compiles the
bundle before scheduling the kernel for invocation.  Therefore, applications
that frequently change the values of specialization constants may see an
overhead associated with recompilation of the kernel's bundle.
====


==== Declaring a specialization constant

Specialization constants must be declared using the [code]#specialization_id#
class with the following restrictions:

* the template parameter [code]#T# must be a <<device copyable>> type;
* the [code]#specialization_id# variable must be declared as [code]#constexpr#;
* the [code]#specialization_id# variable must be declared in either namespace
  scope or in class scope;
* if the [code]#specialization_id# variable is declared in class scope, it must
  have public accessibility when referenced from namespace scope;
* the [code]#specialization_id# variable may not be shadowed by another
  identifier [code]#X# which has the same name and is declared in an
  [code]#inline# namespace, such that the [code]#specialization_id# variable is
  no longer accessible after the declaration of [code]#X#;
* if the [code]#specialization_id# variable is declared in a namespace, none of
  the enclosing namespace names [code]#N# may be shadowed by another identifier
  [code]#X# which has the same name as [code]#N# and is declared in an
  [code]#inline# namespace, such that [code]#N# is no longer accessible after
  the declaration of [code]#X#.

[NOTE]
====
The expectation is that some implementations may conceptually insert code at
the end of a translation unit which references each `specialization_id`
variable that is declared in that translation unit.  The restrictions listed
above make this possible by ensuring that these variables are accessible at the
end of the translation unit.

The following example illustrates some of these restrictions:

==== Setting and getting the value of a specialization constant

If the application uses specialization constants without creating a
[code]#kernel_bundle# object, it can set and get their values from
<<command-group-scope>> by calling member functions of the [code]#handler#
class.  These member functions have a template parameter [code]#SpecName# whose
value must be a reference to a variable of type [code]#specialization_id#,
which defines the type and default value of the specialization constant.

When not using a kernel bundle, the value of a specialization constant that is
used in a kernel invoked from a <<command-group>> is affected by calls to set
its value from that same <<command-group>>, but it is not affected by calls
from other <<command-group,command groups>> even if those calls are from
another invocation of the same <<command-group-function-object>>.

[source]
----
template<auto& SpecName>
void set_specialization_constant(
    typename std::remove_reference_t<decltype(SpecName)>::value_type value);
----

_Effects:_ Sets the value of the specialization constant whose address is
[code]#SpecName# for this handler's <<command-group>>.  If the specialization
constant's value was previously set in this same <<command-group>>, the value
is overwritten.

This function may be called even if the specialization constant
[code]#SpecName# isn't used by the kernel that is invoked by this handler's
<<command-group>>.  Doing so has no effect on the invoked kernel.

_Throws:_

  * An [code]#exception# with the [code]#errc::invalid# error code if
    a kernel bundle has been bound to the [code]#handler# via
    [code]#use_kernel_bundle()#.

[source]
----
template<auto& SpecName>
typename std::remove_reference_t<decltype(SpecName)>::value_type get_specialization_constant();
----

_Returns:_ The value of the specialization constant whose address is
[code]#SpecName# for this handler's <<command-group>>.  If the value was
previously set in this handler's <<command-group>>, that value is returned.
Otherwise, the specialization constant's default value is returned.

_Throws:_

  * An [code]#exception# with the [code]#errc::invalid# error code if
    a kernel bundle has been bound to the [code]#handler# via
    [code]#use_kernel_bundle()#.


[[sec:spec-constants.device-code]]
==== Reading the value of a specialization constant from device code

In order to read the value of a specialization constant from device code, the
<<sycl-kernel-function>> must be declared to take an object of type
[code]#kernel_handler# as its last parameter.  The <<sycl-runtime>> constructs
this object, which has a member function for reading the specialization
constant's value.  A synopsis of this class is shown below.

----


===== Member functions

[source,,linenums]
----
template<auto& SpecName>
typename std::remove_reference_t<decltype(SpecName)>::value_type
get_specialization_constant();
----

_Returns:_ The value of the <<specialization-constant>> whose address is
[code]#SpecName#.  For a kernel invoked from a <<command-group>> that was not
bound to a kernel bundle, the value is the same as what would have been
returned if [code]#handler::get_specialization_constant()# was called
immediately before invoking the kernel.  For a kernel invoked from a
<<command-group>> that was bound to a kernel bundle, the value is the same as
what would be returned if [code]#kernel_bundle::get_specialization_constant()#
was called on the bound bundle.

The following example performs a convolution and uses
<<specialization-constant,specialization constants>> to set the values of the
coefficients.

[[subsec:interfaces.hosttasks]]
== Host tasks


[[sec:interfaces.hosttasks.overview]]
=== Overview

A <<host-task>> is a native {cpp} callable which is scheduled by the
<<sycl-runtime>>. A <<host-task>> is submitted to a <<queue>> via a
<<command-group>> by a <<host-task-command>>.

When a <<host-task-command>> is submitted to a <<queue>> it is scheduled
based on its data dependencies with other <<command,commands>> including
<<kernel-invocation-command,kernel invocation commands>> and asynchronous copies, resolving any
requisites created by <<accessor,accessors>> attached to the <<command-group>> as
defined in <<sub.section.memmodel.app>>.

Since a <<host-task>> is invoked directly by the <<sycl-runtime>> rather
than being compiled as a <<sycl-kernel-function>>, it does not have the same
restrictions as a <<sycl-kernel-function>>, and can therefore contain any
arbitrary {cpp} code. However, capturing or using any SYCL class with reference
semantics (see <<sec:reference-semantics>>) is undefined behavior.

A <<host-task>> can be enqueued on any <<queue>> and the callable will be
invoked directly by the SYCL runtime, regardless of which <<device>> the
<<queue>> is associated with.

A <<host-task>> is enqueued on a <<queue>> via the [code]#host_task#
member function of the [code]#handler# class.
The <<event>> returned by the submission of the associated <<command group>>
enters the completed state (corresponding to a status of
[code]#info::event_command_status::complete#) once the invocation of the
provided {cpp} callable has returned.

A <<host-task>> can optionally be used to interoperate with the
<<native-backend-object,native backend objects>> associated with the <<queue>> executing the
<<host-task>>, the <<context>> that the <<queue>> is associated with, the
<<device>> that the <<queue>> is associated with  and the <<accessor,accessors>>
that have been captured in the callable, via an optional
[code]#interop_handle# parameter.

This allows <<host-task,host tasks>> to be used for two purposes: either as a
task which can perform arbitrary {cpp} code within the scheduling of the
<<sycl-runtime>> or as a task which can perform interoperability at a point
within the scheduling of the <<sycl-runtime>>.

For the former use case, construct a buffer accessor with
[code]#target::host_task# or an image accessor with
[code]#image_target::host_task#.  This makes the buffer or image available
on the host during execution of the <<host-task>>.

For the latter case, construct a buffer accessor with
[code]#target::device# or [code]#target::constant_buffer#, or construct
an image accessor with [code]#image_target::device#.  This makes the buffer or
image available on the device that is associated with the queue used to submit
the <<host-task>>, so that it can be accessed via interoperability member
functions provided by the [code]#interop_handle# class.

Local <<accessor,accessors>> cannot be used within a <<host-task>>.

<<native-backend-object>> associated with the <<queue>>, <<device>>,
<<context>> and any <<buffer,buffers>> or <<image,images>> that are captured in

for interoperability purposes.

[[sec:interfaces.bundles]]
== Kernel bundles

Kernel bundles provide several features to a <<sycl-application>>.  For
implementations that support an online compiler, they provide fine grained
control over the online compilation of device code.  For example, an
application can use a kernel bundle to compile its <<kernel,kernels>> at a
specific time during the application's execution (such as during its
initialization), rather than relying on the implementation's default behavior
(which may not compile kernels until they are submitted).

Kernel bundles also provide a way for the application to set the values of
specialization constants in many kernels before any of them are submitted to
a device, which could potentially be more efficient in some cases.

Kernel bundles provide a way for the application to introspect its kernels.
For example, an application can use a bundle to query a kernel's work-group
size when it is run on a specific device.

Finally, kernel bundles provide an extension point to interoperate with backend
and device specific features.  Some examples of this include invocation of
device specific built-in kernels, online compilation of kernel code with vendor
specific options, or interoperation with kernels created with backend APIs.


=== Overview

A kernel bundle is a high-level abstraction which represents a set of
<<kernel,kernels>> that are associated with a <<context>> and can be executed
on a number of <<device,devices>>, where each device is associated with that
same context.  Depending on how a bundle is obtained, it could represent all of
the <<sycl-kernel-function,SYCL kernel functions>> in the <<sycl-application>>,
or a certain subset of them.

A kernel bundle is composed of one or more <<device-image,device images>>,
where each device image is an indivisible unit of compilation and/or linking.
When the <<sycl-runtime>> compiles or links one of the kernels represented by
the device image, it must also compile or link any other kernels the device
image represents.  Once a device image is compiled and linked, any of the other
kernels which that device image represents may be invoked without further
compilation or linking.

Each <<sycl-kernel-function>> a bundle represents must reside in at least one
of the bundle's device images.  However, it is not necessary for each device
image to contain all of the kernel functions that the bundle represents.  The
granularity in which kernel functions are grouped into device images is an
implementation detail.

[NOTE]
====
To illustrate the intent of device images, a hypothetical implementation could
represent an application's kernel functions in both the SPIR-V format and also
in a native device code format.  The implementation's ahead-of-time compiler
in this example produces device images with native code for certain devices and
also produces SPIR-V device images for use with other devices.  Note that in
such an implementation, a particular kernel function could be represented in
more than one device image.

An implementation could choose to have all kernel functions from all
translation units grouped together in a single device image, to have each
kernel function represented in its own device image, or to group kernel
functions in some other way.
====

Each device associated with a kernel bundle must have at least one compatible
device image, meaning that the implementation can either invoke the image's
kernel functions directly on the device or that the implementation can
translate the device image into a format that allows it to invoke the kernel
functions.

An outcome of this definition is that each kernel function in a bundle must be
invocable on at least one of the devices associated with the bundle.  However,
it is not necessary for every kernel function in the bundle to be invocable on
every associated device.

[NOTE]
====
One common reason why a kernel function might not be invocable on every device
associated with a bundle is if the kernel uses optional device features.  It's
possible that these features are available to only some devices in the bundle.

The use of optional device features could affect how the implementation groups
kernels into device images, depending on how these features are represented.
For example, consider an implementation where the optional feature is
represented in SPIR-V but translation of that SPIR-V into native code will fail
if the target device does not support the feature.  In such an implementation,
kernels that use optional features should not be grouped into the same device
image as kernels that do not use these features.  Since a device image is an
indivisible unit of compilation, doing so would cause a compilation failure if
a kernel K1 is invoked on a device D1 if K1 happened to reside in the same
device image as another kernel K2 that used a feature which is not supported on
device D1.

See <<sec:optional-kernel-features>> for more about optional device features.
====

A <<sycl-application>> can obtain a kernel bundle by calling one of the
overloads of the [code]#get_kernel_bundle()# free function.  Certain backends
may provide additional mechanisms for obtaining bundles with other
representations.  If this is supported, the backend specification document will
describe the details.

Once a kernel bundle has been obtained there are a number of free functions for
performing compilation, linking and joining.  Once a bundle is compiled and
linked, the application can invoke kernels from the bundle by calling
[code]#handler::use_kernel_bundle()# as described in
<<sec:handler.usekernelbundle>>.

=== Fixed-function built-in kernels

SYCL allows a <<backend>> to expose fixed functionality as non-programmable
built-in kernels.  The availability and behavior of these built-in kernels are
backend specific and are not required to follow the SYCL execution and memory
models.  However, the basic interface is common to all backends.


[[sec:interfaces.bundles.bundlestate]]
=== Bundle states

A <<kernel-bundle>> can be in one of three different
<<bundle-state,bundle states>> which are represented by an enum class called
[code]#bundle_state#.  <<table.bundles.states>> describes the semantics of
these three states.

The states form a progression.  A bundle in [code]#bundle_state::input# can
be translated into [code]#bundle_state::object# by online compilation of the
bundle.  A bundle in [code]#bundle_state::object# can be translated into
[code]#bundle_state::executable# by online linking.

[NOTE]
====
Each implementation is free to define the "online compilation" and "online
linking" operations as it sees fit, so long as this progression of bundle
states is preserved and so long as the bundles in each state behave as
specified.
====

There is no requirement that an implementation must expose kernels in
[code]#bundle_state::input# or [code]#bundle_state::object#.  In fact, an
implementation could expose some kernels in these states but not others.  For
example, this behavior could be controlled by implementation specific options
to the ahead-of-time compiler.  Kernels that are not exposed in these states
cannot be online compiled or online linked by the application.

All kernels defined in the <<sycl-application>>, however, must be exposed in
[code]#bundle_state::executable# because this is the only state that allows a
kernel to be invoked on a device.  Device built-in kernels are also exposed
in [code]#bundle_state::executable#.

If an application exposes a bundle in [code]#bundle_state::input# for a device
D, then the implementation must also provide an online compiler for device D.
Therefore, an application need not explicitly test for
[code]#aspect::online_compiler# if it successfully obtains a bundle in
[code]#bundle_state::input# for that device.  Likewise, an implementation must
provide an online linker for device D if it exposes a bundle in
[code]#bundle_state::object# for device D.

=== Kernel identifiers

Some of the functions related to kernel bundles take an input parameter of type
[code]#kernel_id# which identifies a kernel.  A synopsis of the
[code]#kernel_id# class is shown below along with a description of its member
functions.  Additionally, this class provides the common special member
functions and common member functions that are listed in
<<sec:reference-semantics>> in <<table.specialmembers.common.reference>> and
<<table.hiddenfriends.common.reference>>, respectively.

As with all SYCL objects that have the common reference semantics, kernel
identifiers are equality comparable.  Two [code]#kernel_id# objects compare
equal if and only if they refer to the same application kernel or to the same
device built-in kernel.

There is no public default constructor for this class.

[source,,linenums]
----
include::{header_dir}/bundle/kernelIdClass.h[lines=4..-1]
----

[source]
----
const char *get_name() const noexcept;
----

_Returns:_ An implementation-defined null-terminated string containing the
name of the kernel.  There is no guarantee that this name is unique amongst
all the kernels, nor is there a guarantee that the name is stable from one
run of the application to another.  The lifetime of the memory containing the
name is unspecified.

[NOTE]
====
In practice, the lifetime of the memory containing the name will typically
extend until the application terminates, unless the kernel associated with
the name comes from a dynamic library.  In this case, the lifetime of the
memory may end if the dynamic library is unloaded.
====


=== Obtaining a kernel identifier

An application can obtain an identifier for a kernel that is defined in the
application by calling one of the following free functions, or it may obtain an
identifier for a device's built-in kernels by querying the device with
[code]#info::device::built_in_kernel_ids#.

[source]
----
template <typename KernelName>
kernel_id get_kernel_id();
----

_Preconditions:_ The template parameter [code]#KernelName# must be the
<<type-kernel-name>> of a kernel that is defined in the <<sycl-application>>.
Since lambda functions have no standard type name, kernels defined as lambda
functions must specify a [code]#KernelName# in their
<<kernel-invocation-command>> in order to obtain their identifier via this
function.  Applications which call [code]#get_kernel_id()# for a
[code]#KernelName# that is not defined are ill formed, and the implementation
must issue a diagnostic in this case.

_Returns:_ The identifier of the kernel associated with [code]#KernelName#.

[source]
----
std::vector<kernel_id> get_kernel_ids();
----

_Returns:_ A vector with the identifiers for all kernels defined in the
<<sycl-application>>.  This does not include identifiers for any device
built-in kernels.


=== Obtaining a kernel bundle

A <<sycl-application>> can obtain a kernel bundle by calling one of the
overloads of the free function [code]#get_kernel_bundle()#.  The implementation
may return a bundle that consists of device images that were created by the
ahead-of-time compiler, or it may call the online compiler or linker to create
the bundle's device images in the requested state.  A bundle may also contain
device images that represent a device's built-in kernels.

When [code]#get_kernel_bundle()# is used to obtain a kernel bundle in
[code]#bundle_state::object# or [code]#bundle_state::executable#, any
specialization constants in the bundle will have their default values.

[source]
----
template<bundle_state State>
kernel_bundle<State> get_kernel_bundle(const context &ctxt, const std::vector<device> &devs);
----

_Returns:_ A kernel bundle in state [code]#State# which contains all of the
<<kernel,kernels>> in the application which are compatible with at least one of
the devices in [code]#devs#.  This does not include any device built-in kernels.
The bundle's set of associated devices is [code]#devs# (with any duplicate
devices removed).

Since the implementation may not represent all kernels in
[code]#bundle_state::input# or [code]#bundle_state::object#, calling this
function with one of those states may return a bundle that is missing some of
the application's kernels.

_Throws:_

  * An [code]#exception# with the [code]#errc::invalid# error code if any of
    the devices in [code]#devs# is not in the list of devices associated with
    the context [code]#ctxt# or if the [code]#devs# vector is empty.
  * An [code]#exception# with the [code]#errc::invalid# error code if
    [code]#State# is [code]#bundle_state::input# and any device in [code]#devs#
    does not have [code]#aspect::online_compiler#.
  * An [code]#exception# with the [code]#errc::invalid# error code if
    [code]#State# is [code]#bundle_state::object# and any device in [code]#devs#
    does not have [code]#aspect::online_linker#.
  * An [code]#exception# with the [code]#errc::build# error code if
    [code]#State# is [code]#bundle_state::object# or
    [code]#bundle_state::executable#, if the implementation needs to perform an
    online compile or link, and if the online compile or link fails.

                                       const std::vector<kernel_id> &kernelIds);
----

_Returns:_ A kernel bundle in state [code]#State# which contains all of the
device images that are compatible with at least one of the devices in
[code]#devs#, further filtered to contain only those device images that contain
at least one of the kernels with the given identifiers.  These identifiers may
represent kernels that are defined in the application, device built-in kernels,
or a mixture of the two.  Since the device images may group many kernels
together, the returned bundle may contain additional kernels beyond those that
are requested in [code]#kernelIds#.  The bundle's set of associated devices is
[code]#devs# (with duplicate devices removed).

Since the implementation may not represent all kernels in
[code]#bundle_state::input# or [code]#bundle_state::object#, calling this
function with one of those states may return a bundle that is missing some of
the kernels in [code]#kernelIds#.  The application can test for this via
[code]#kernel_bundle::has_kernel()#.

_Throws:_

  * An [code]#exception# with the [code]#errc::invalid# error code if any of
    the kernels identified by [code]#kernelIds# are incompatible with all
    devices in [code]#devs#.
  * An [code]#exception# with the [code]#errc::invalid# error code if any of

  * An [code]#exception# with the [code]#errc::build# error code if
    [code]#State# is [code]#bundle_state::object# or

    online compile or link, and if the online compile or link fails.

----

_Preconditions:_ The [code]#selector# must be a unary predicate whose return

device image in the application of state [code]#State# which is compatible
with at least one of the devices in [code]#devs#.  The function's return value
determines whether a device image is included in the new kernel bundle.  The
[code]#selector# is called only for device images that contain kernels defined
in the application, not for device images that contain device built-in kernels.

_Returns:_ A kernel bundle in state [code]#State# which contains all of the
device images for which the [code]#selector# returns [code]#true#.  The
bundle's set of associated devices is [code]#devs# (with duplicate devices
removed).

_Throws:_

  * An [code]#exception# with the [code]#errc::invalid# error code if any of

[NOTE]
====
This function is intended to be used in conjunction with backend specific APIs
that allow the application to choose device images based on backend specific
criteria.

This function does not call the online compiler or linker to translate device
images into state [code]#State#.  If the application wants to select specific
device images and also compile or link them into the desired state, it can do
this by calling [code]#compile()# or [code]#link()# and then optionally joining
several bundles together with [code]#join()#.

=== Querying if a kernel is compatible with a device

The following free functions allow an application to test whether a particular
kernel is compatible with a device.  A kernel that is defined in the
application is compatible with a device unless:

* It uses optional features which are not supported on the device, as described
  in <<sec:optional-kernel-features>>; or
* It is decorated with a [code]#[[sycl::device_has()]]# {cpp} attribute that
  lists an aspect that is not supported by the device, as described in
  <<sec:kernel.attributes>>.

A device built-in kernel is only compatible with the device for which it is
built-in.

=== Joining kernel bundles

Two or more kernel bundles of the same state may be joined together into a
single composite bundle.  Joining bundles together is not the same as online
compiling or linking because it produces a new bundle in the same state as its
inputs.  Rather, joining creates the union of all the devices images from the
input bundles, eliminates duplicate copies of the same device image, and
creates a new bundle from the result.

=== Online compiling and linking

If the implementation provides an online compiler or linker, a
<<sycl-application>> can use the free functions defined in this section to
transform a kernel bundle from [code]#bundle_state::input# into a bundle of
state [code]#bundle_state::object# or to transform a bundle from
[code]#bundle_state::object# into a bundle of state
[code]#bundle_state::executable#.

An application can query whether the implementation provides an online compiler
or linker by querying a device for [code]#aspect::online_compiler# or
[code]#aspect::online_linker#.

All of the functions in this section accept a [code]#property_list# parameter,
which can affect the semantics of the compilation or linking operation.  The
<<core-spec>> does not currently define any such properties, but vendors may
specify these properties as an extension.

----

_Effects:_ The device images from [code]#inputBundle# are translated into one
or more new device images of state [code]#bundle_state::object#, and a new
kernel bundle is created to contain these new device images.  The new bundle
represents all of the <<kernel,kernels>> in [code]#inputBundles# that are
compatible with at least one of the devices in [code]#devs#.  Any remaining
kernels (those that are not compatible with any of the devices [code]#devs#)
are not compiled and not represented in the new kernel bundle.

as though they were joined via [code]#join()#, then the remaining device images
are translated into one or more new device images of state
[code]#bundle_state::executable#, and a new kernel bundle is created to contain

=== The [code]#kernel_bundle# class

A synopsis of the [code]#kernel_bundle# class is shown below.  Additionally,
this class provides the common special member functions and common member
functions that are listed in <<sec:reference-semantics>> in
<<table.specialmembers.common.reference>> and
<<table.hiddenfriends.common.reference>>, respectively.

As with all SYCL objects that have the common reference semantics, kernel
bundles are equality comparable.  Two bundles of the same <<bundle-state>> are
considered to be equal if they are associated with the same context, have the
same set of associated devices, and contain the same set of device images.

There is no public default constructor for this class.

----

  . _Returns:_ [code]#true# only if the kernel bundle contains the kernel
    identified by [code]#kernelId#.
  . _Returns:_ [code]#true# only if the kernel bundle contains the kernel

bool has_kernel() const noexcept;                   // (1)

----

_Preconditions:_ The template parameter [code]#KernelName# must be the
<<type-kernel-name>> of a kernel that is defined in the <<sycl-application>>.
Since lambda functions have no standard type name, kernels defined as lambda
functions must specify a [code]#KernelName# in their
<<kernel-invocation-command>> in order to use these functions.  Applications
which call these functions for a [code]#KernelName# that is not defined are ill
formed, and the implementation must issue a diagnostic in this case.

the kernel bundle.

[source]
----
kernel get_kernel(const kernel_id &kernelId) const;
----

_Preconditions:_ This member function is only available if the kernel bundle's
state is [code]#bundle_state::executable#.

_Returns:_ A [code]#kernel# object representing the kernel identified by

[source]
----
template<typename KernelName>
kernel get_kernel() const;

_Preconditions:_ This member function is only available if the kernel bundle's
state is [code]#bundle_state::executable#.  The template parameter
[code]#KernelName# must be the <<type-kernel-name>> of a kernel that is defined
in the <<sycl-application>>.  Since lambda functions have no standard type
name, kernels defined as lambda functions must specify a [code]#KernelName# in
their <<kernel-invocation-command>> in order to use this function.
Applications which call this function for a [code]#KernelName# that is not
defined are ill formed, and the implementation must issue a diagnostic in this
case.

[code]#KernelName#, which resides in the bundle.

_Throws:_

  * An [code]#exception# with the [code]#errc::invalid# error code if the
    kernel bundle does not contain the kernel identified by [code]#KernelName#.

==== Specialization constant support

The following member functions allow an application to manipulate
<<specialization-constant,specialization constants>> that are used in the
device images of a <<kernel-bundle>>.  Applications can set the value of
specialization constants in a kernel bundle whose state is
[code]#bundle_state::input# and then online compile that bundle into
[code]#bundle_state::object# or [code]#bundle_state::executable#.  The value of
the specialization constants then become fixed in the compiled bundle and
cannot be changed.  Specialization constants that have not had their values set
by the time the bundle is compiled take their default values.

[NOTE]
====
It is expected that many implementations will use an intermediate language
representation for a bundle in state [code]#bundle_state::input# such as
SPIR-V, and the intermediate language will have native support for
specialization constants.  However, implementations that do not have such
native support must still support specialization constants in some other way.
====

[source]
----
bool contains_specialization_constants() const noexcept;
----

_Returns:_ [code]#true# only if the kernel bundle contains at least one device
image which uses a specialization constant.

[source]
----
bool native_specialization_constant() const noexcept;
----

_Returns:_ [code]#true# only if all specialization constants used in the kernel
bundle are <<native-specialization-constant,native specialization constants>>
in all of the bundle's device images.

[source]
----
template<auto& SpecName>
bool has_specialization_constant() const noexcept;
----

_Returns:_ [code]#true# if any device image in the kernel bundle uses the
specialization constant whose address is [code]#SpecName#.

[source]
----
template<auto& SpecName>
void set_specialization_constant(
  typename std::remove_reference_t<decltype(SpecName)>::value_type value);
----

_Preconditions:_ This member function is only available if the kernel bundle's
state is [code]#bundle_state::input#.

_Effects:_ Sets the value of the <<specialization-constant>> whose address is
[code]#SpecName# for this bundle.  If the specialization constant's value was
previously set in this bundle, the value is overwritten.

The new value applies to all device images in the bundle.  It is allowed to set
the value of a specialization constant even if no device image in the bundle
uses it; doing so has no effect on the execution of kernels from that bundle.

[source]
----
template<auto& SpecName>
typename std::remove_reference_t<decltype(SpecName)>::value_type
get_specialization_constant() const;
----

_Returns:_ The value of the <<specialization-constant>> whose address is
[code]#SpecName# for this kernel bundle.  The value returned is as follows:

* If the value of this specialization constant was previously set in this
  bundle, that value is returned.  Otherwise,

* If this bundle is the result of compiling, linking or joining another
  bundle and this specialization constant was set in that other bundle prior
  to compiling, linking or joining; then that value is returned.  Otherwise,

* The specialization constant's default value is returned.

==== Device image support

The following member type and functions allow iteration over the
<<device-image,device images>> contained by the kernel bundle.

[source]
----
using device_image_iterator = __unspecified__;
----

An iterator type that satisfies the {cpp} requirements of
[code]#LegacyForwardIterator#.  The iterator's referenced type is
[code]#const device_image<State>#, where [code]#State# is the same state as the
containing [code]#kernel_bundle#.

[source]
----
device_image_iterator begin() const;  // (1)
device_image_iterator end() const;    // (2)
----

  .  _Returns:_ An iterator to the first <<device-image>> contained by the
     kernel bundle.
  .  _Returns:_ An iterator to one past the last <<device-image>> contained by
     the kernel bundle.

=== Example usage

This section provides some examples showing typical use cases for kernel
bundles.  These examples are intended to clarify the definition of the kernel
bundle interfaces, but the content of this section is non-normative.

==== Controlling the timing of online compilation

In some cases an application may want to pre-compile its kernels before
submitting them to a device.  This gives the application control over when the
overhead of online compilation happens, rather than relying on the default
behavior (which may cause the online compilation to happen at the point when
the kernel is submitted to a device).  The following example shows how this can
be achieved.

[source,,linenums]
----
include::{code_dir}/bundle-pre-compile.cpp[lines=4..-1]
----

==== Specialization constants

An application can use a kernel bundle to set the values of specialization
constants in several kernels before any of them are submitted for execution.

[source,,linenums]
----
include::{code_dir}/bundle-spec-constants.cpp[lines=4..-1]
----

==== Kernel introspection

Applications can use kernel bundles to introspect its kernels and use that
information to tune the arguments passed when invoking it.

[source,,linenums]
----
include::{code_dir}/bundle-kernel-introspection.cpp[lines=4..-1]
----

==== Invoking a device built-in kernel

An application can use kernel bundles to invoke a device's built-in kernels.

[source,,linenums]
----
include::{code_dir}/bundle-builtin-kernel.cpp[lines=4..-1]
----


== Defining kernels

In SYCL, functions that are executed on a SYCL device are referred to
as <<sycl-kernel-function,SYCL kernel functions>>. A <<kernel>> containing such a
<<sycl-kernel-function>> is enqueued on a device queue in order to
be executed on that particular device.

The return type of the <<sycl-kernel-function>> is [code]#void#, and all memory
accesses between host and device are through <<accessor,accessors>> or through
<<sec:usm, USM pointers>>.

There are two ways of defining kernels: as named function objects or as
lambda functions. A backend may also provide interoperability interfaces for
defining kernels.


[[sec:interfaces.kernels.as.function-objects]]
=== Defining kernels as named function objects

A kernel can be defined as a named function object type. These function objects
provide the same functionality as any {cpp} function object, with the
restriction that they need to follow SYCL rules to be <<device-copyable>>.
The kernel function can be templated via templating the kernel
function object type. For details on restrictions for kernel naming,
please refer to <<sec:naming.kernels>>.

The [code]#operator()# member function must be const-qualified, and it may take
different parameters depending on the data accesses defined for the specific
kernel.  If the [code]#operator()# function writes to any of the member variables,
the behavior is undefined.

The following example defines a <<sycl-kernel-function>>,
_RandomFiller_, which initializes a buffer with a random number. The
random number is generated during the construction of the function object
while processing the command group. The [code]#operator()# member
function of the function object receives an [code]#item# object. This
member function will be called for each work item of the execution range. The value
of the random number will be assigned to each element of the buffer. In this
case, the accessor and the scalar random number are members of the function
object and therefore will be arguments to the device kernel. Usual
restrictions of passing arguments to kernels apply.

[source,,linenums]
----
include::{code_dir}/myfunctor.cpp[lines=4..-1]
----


[[sec:interfaces.kernels.as.lambdas]]
=== Defining kernels as lambda functions

In {cpp}, function objects can be defined using lambda functions. Kernels may be
defined as lambda functions in SYCL.  The name of a lambda function
in SYCL may optionally be specified by passing it as a template parameter to the invoking
member function, and in that case, the lambda name is a [keyword]#{cpp} typename# which must
be forward declarable at namespace scope. If the lambda
function relies on template arguments, then if specified,
the name of the lambda function must contain those template arguments which must
also be forward declarable at namespace scope. The
class used for the name of a lambda function is only used for naming purposes
and is not required to be defined. For details on restrictions for kernel
naming, please refer to <<sec:naming.kernels>>.

The kernel function for the lambda function is the lambda function itself.
The kernel lambda must use copy for all of its captures (i.e. [code]#[=]#), and
the lambda must not use the [code]#mutable# specifier.

[source,,linenums]
----
include::{code_dir}/mykernel.cpp[lines=4..-1]
----

Explicit lambda naming is shown in the following code example,
including an illegal case that uses a class within the kernel
name which is not forward declarable ([code]#std::complex#).

[source,,linenums]
----
include::{code_dir}/lambdaNameExamples.cpp[lines=4..-1]
----

=== [code]#is_device_copyable# type trait

....
namespace sycl {
    template<typename T>
    struct is_device_copyable;

    template<typename T>
    inline constexpr bool is_device_copyable_v = is_device_copyable<T>::value;
};
....

[code]#is_device_copyable# is a user specializable class template to indicate
that a type [code]#T# is <<device-copyable>>.

  * [code]#is_device_copyable# must meet the Cpp17UnaryTrait requirements.
  * If [code]#is_device_copyable# is specialized such that
    [code]#is_device_copyable_v<T> == true# on a [code]#T# that does not
    satisfy all the requirements of a device copyable type, the results are
    unspecified.

If the application defines a type [code]#UDT# that satisfies the requirements of
a <<device-copyable>> type (as defined in <<sec::device.copyable>>) but the type
is not implicitly device copyable as defined in that section, then the
application must provide a specialization of [code]#is_device_copyable# that
derives from [code]#std:true_type# in order to use that type in a context that
requires a device copyable type.  Such a specialization can be declared like
this:

....
template<>
struct sycl::is_device_copyable<UDT> : std::true_type {};
....

It is legal to provide this specialization even if the implementation does not
define [code]#SYCL_DEVICE_COPYABLE# to [code]#1#, but the type cannot be used
as a device copyable type in that case and the specialization is ignored.


[[sec:kernel.parameter.passing]]
=== Rules for parameter passing to kernels

A SYCL application passes parameters to a kernel in different ways depending on
whether the kernel is a named function object or a lambda function.  If the
kernel is a named function object, the [code]#operator()# member function (or
other member functions that it calls) may reference member variables inside the
same named function object.  Any such member variables become parameters to the
kernel.  If the kernel is a lambda function, any variables captured by the
lambda become parameters to the kernel.

Regardless of how the parameter is passed, the following rules define the
allowable types for a kernel parameter:

* Any <<device-copyable>> type is a legal parameter type.

* The following SYCL types are legal parameter types:
  - [code]#accessor# when templated with [code]#target::device#;
  - [code]#accessor# when templated with any of the deprecated parameters:
    [code]#target::global_buffer#, [code]#target::constant_buffer#, or
    [code]#target::local#;
  - [code]#local_accessor#;
  - [code]#unsampled_image_accessor# when templated with
    [code]#image_target::device#;
  - [code]#sampled_image_accessor# when templated with
    [code]#image_target::device#;
  - [code]#stream#;
  - [code]#id#;
  - [code]#range#;
  - [code]#marray<T, NumElements># when [code]#T# is <<device-copyable>>;
  - [code]#vec<T, NumElements>#.

* An array of element types [code]#T# is a legal parameter type if [code]#T# is
  a legal parameter type.

* A class type [code]#S# with a non-static member variable of type [code]#T# is
  a legal parameter type if [code]#T# is a legal parameter type and if
  [code]#S# would otherwise be a legal parameter type aside from this member
  variable.

* A class type [code]#S# with a non-virtual base class of type [code]#T# is a
  legal parameter type if [code]#T# is a legal parameter type and if [code]#S#
  would otherwise be a legal parameter type aside from this base class.

[NOTE]
====
Pointer types are trivially copyable, so they may be passed as kernel
parameters.  However, only the pointer value itself is passed to the kernel.
Dereferencing the pointer on the kernel results in undefined behavior unless
the pointer points to an address within a <<usm>> memory region that is
accessible on the device.

Reference types are not trivially copyable, so they may not be passed as
kernel parameters.
====

[NOTE]
====
The [code]#reducer# class is a special type of kernel parameter which is passed
to a kernel in a different way.  <<sec:reduction>> describes how this parameter
type is used.

[[error-handling]]
== Error handling

=== Error handling rules

Error handling in a SYCL application (host code) uses {cpp} exceptions. If an error
occurs, it will be thrown by the API function call and may be caught by the user
through standard {cpp} exception handling mechanisms.

SYCL applications are asynchronous in the sense that host and device code executions
are decoupled from one another except at specific points. For example, device code
executions often begin when dependencies in the SYCL task graph are satisfied, which
occurs asynchronously from host code execution.  As a result of this the errors
that occur on a device cannot be thrown directly from a host API call, because the call
enqueueing a device action has typically already returned by the time that the error
occurs. Such errors are not detected until the error-causing task executes or tries to
execute, and we refer to these as <<async-error,asynchronous errors>>.


[[subsubsec:exception.async]]
==== Asynchronous error handler

The queue and context classes can optionally take an asynchronous handler object
<<async-handler>> on construction, which is a callable such as a function class
or lambda, with an [code]#exception_list# as a parameter.
Invocation of an <<async-handler>> may be triggered by the queue member functions
[code]#queue::wait_and_throw()# or [code]#queue::throw_asynchronous()#, by
the event member function [code]#event::wait_and_throw()#, or
automatically on destruction of a queue or context that contains unconsumed
asynchronous errors.  When invoked, an <<async-handler>> is called and receives an
[code]#exception_list# argument containing a list of exception objects representing
any unconsumed <<async-error,asynchronous errors>> associated with the queue or context.

When an <<async-error>> instance has been passed to an <<async-handler>>, then
that instance of the error has been consumed for handling and is not reported on
any subsequent invocations of the <<async-handler>>.

The <<async-handler>> may be a named function object type, a lambda
function or a [code]#std::function#. The [code]#exception_list#
object passed to the <<async-handler>> is constructed by the <<sycl-runtime>>.


[[subsubsec:exception.nohandler]]
==== Behavior without an <<async-handler>>

If an asynchronous error occurs in a queue or context that has no user-supplied
asynchronous error handler object <<async-handler>>, then an implementation-defined
default <<async-handler>> is called to handle the error in the same situations that
a user-supplied <<async-handler>> would be, as defined in
<<subsubsec:exception.async>>.  The default <<async-handler>> must in some way
report all errors passed to it, when possible, and must then invoke
[code]#std::terminate# or equivalent.

==== Priorities of <<async-handler,async handlers>>

If the SYCL runtime can associate an <<async-error>> with a specific queue,
then:

  * If the queue was constructed with an <<async-handler>>, that handler
    is invoked to handle the error.
  * Otherwise if the context enclosed by the queue was constructed with an
    <<async-handler>>, that handler is invoked to handle the error.
  * Otherwise when no handler was passed to either queue or context on
    construction, then a default handler is invoked to handle the error, as
    described by <<subsubsec:exception.nohandler>>.
  * All handler invocations in this list occur at times as defined by
    <<subsubsec:exception.async>>.

If the SYCL runtime cannot associate an <<async-error>> with a specific queue,
then:

  * If the context in which the error occurred was constructed with an
    <<async-handler>>, then that handler is invoked to handle the error.
  * Otherwise when no handler was passed to the associated context on
    construction, then a default handler is invoked to handle the error, as
    described by <<subsubsec:exception.nohandler>>.
  * All handler invocations in this list occur at times as defined by
    <<subsubsec:exception.async>>.


==== Asynchronous errors with a secondary queue

If an <<async-error>> occurs when running or enqueuing a command group which has
a secondary queue specified, then the command group may be enqueued
to the secondary queue instead of the primary queue. The error handling in this
case is also configured using the <<async-handler>> provided for both
queues. If there is no <<async-handler>> given on any of the queues,
then no asynchronous error reporting is done and no exceptions are thrown. If
the primary queue fails and there is an <<async-handler>> given at
this queue's construction, which populates the [code]#exception_list#
parameter, then any errors will be added and can be thrown whenever the user
chooses to handle those exceptions. Since there were errors on the primary
queue and a secondary queue was given, then the execution of the kernel is
re-scheduled to the secondary queue and any error reporting for the kernel
execution on that queue is done through that queue, in the same way as
described above. The secondary queue may fail as well, and the errors will be
thrown if there is an <<async-handler>> and either
[code]#wait_and_throw()# or [code]#throw()# are called on that queue.
The <<command-group-function-object>> event returned by that function will be
relevant to the queue where the kernel has been enqueued.

the error message.

The SYCL [code]#exception_list#
class is also available in order to provide a list of synchronous and
asynchronous exceptions.

Errors can occur both in the SYCL library and SYCL host side, or may come
directly from a <<backend>>. The member functions on these exceptions provide the
corresponding information.
<<backend, SYCL backends>> can provide additional exception class objects as long as they derive
from [code]#sycl::exception# object, or any of its derived classes.

A specialization of [code]#std::is_error_code_enum# must be defined
for [code]#sycl::errc# and [code]#backend_traits<Backend>::errc#

== Data types

SYCL as a {cpp} programming model supports the {cpp} core language data types,
and it also provides the ability for all SYCL applications to be executed on SYCL
compatible devices. The scalar and vector data types that
are supported by the SYCL system are defined below. More details about the SYCL
device compiler support for fundamental and backend interoperability types are found
in <<subsec:scalartypes>>.


=== Scalar data types

The fundamental {cpp} data types which are supported in SYCL are described in
<<table.types.fundamental>>. Note these types are fundamental and therefore
do not exist within the [code]#sycl# namespace.

Additional scalar data types which are supported by SYCL within the
[code]#sycl# namespace are described in
<<table.types.additional>>.

[[sec:vector.type]]
=== Vector types

SYCL provides a cross-platform class template that works
efficiently on SYCL devices as well as in host {cpp} code. This type
allows sharing of vectors between the host and its SYCL devices. The
vector supports member functions that allow construction of a new vector from a
swizzled set of component elements.

[code]#vec<typename _DataT_, int _NumElements_>#
is a vector type
that compiles down to a <<backend>> built-in vector types on SYCL devices,
where possible, and provides compatible support on the host or when it is
not possible. The [code]#vec# class is templated on its number of
elements and its element type. The number of elements parameter,
_NumElements_, can be one of: 1, 2, 3, 4, 8 or 16. Any other value shall
produce a compilation failure. The element type parameter, _DataT_, must
be one of the basic scalar types supported in device code.

The SYCL [code]#vec# class template provides interoperability with the
underlying vector type defined by [code]#vector_t# which is
available only when compiled for the device. The SYCL [code]#vec# class can
be constructed from an instance of [code]#vector_t# and can implicitly
convert to an instance of [code]#vector_t# in order to support
interoperability with native <<backend>> functions from a SYCL kernel function.

An instance of the SYCL [code]#vec# class template can also be
implicitly converted to an instance of the data type when the number of
elements is [code]#1# in order to allow single element vectors and
scalars to be convertible with each other.

==== Vec interface

[code]#vec# class template are listed in

==== Aliases

The SYCL programming API provides all permutations of the type alias:

[code]#+using <type><elems> = vec<<storage-type>, <elems>>+#

where [code]#<elems># is [code]#2#, [code]#3#, [code]#4#,
[code]#8# and [code]#16#, and pairings of [code]#<type># and
[code]#<storage-type># for integral types are [code]#char# and
[code]#int8_t#, [code]#uchar# and [code]#uint8_t#,
[code]#short# and [code]#int16_t#, [code]#ushort# and
[code]#uint16_t#, [code]#int# and [code]#int32_t#,
[code]#uint# and [code]#uint32_t#, [code]#long# and
[code]#int64_t#, [code]#ulong# and [code]#uint64_t#, and for
floating point types are both [code]#half#, [code]#float# and
[code]#double#.

For example [code]#uint4# is the alias to [code]#vec<uint32_t, 4>#
and [code]#float16# is the alias to [code]#vec<float, 16>#.

==== Swizzles

Swizzle operations can be performed in two ways. Firstly by calling the
[code]#swizzle# member function template, which takes a variadic number
of integer template arguments between [code]#0# and
[code]#NumElements-1#, specifying swizzle indexes. Secondly by calling
one of the simple swizzle member functions defined in
<<table.members.vec>> as [code]#XYZW_SWIZZLE# and
[code]#RGBA_SWIZZLE#. Note that the simple swizzle functions are only
available for up to 4 element vectors and are only available when the macro
[code]#SYCL_SIMPLE_SWIZZLES# is defined before including
[code]#<sycl/sycl.hpp>#.

In both cases the return type is always an instance of
[code]#+__swizzled_vec__+#, an implementation-defined temporary class
representing a swizzle of the original SYCL [code]#vec# instance. Both
kinds of swizzle member functions must not perform the swizzle operation
themselves, instead the swizzle operation must be performed by the returned
instance of [code]#+__swizzled_vec__+# when used within an expression,
meaning if the returned [code]#+__swizzled_vec__+# is never used in an
expression no swizzle operation is performed.

Both the [code]#swizzle# member function template and the simple
swizzle member functions allow swizzle indexes to be repeated.

A series of static constexpr values are provided within the
[code]#elem# struct to allow specifying named swizzle indexes when
calling the [code]#swizzle# member function template.


[[swizzled-vec-class]]
==== Swizzled [code]#vec# class

The [code]#+__swizzled_vec__+# class must define an unspecified
temporary which provides the entire interface of the SYCL [code]#vec#
class template, including swizzled member functions, with the additions and
alterations described below:

  * The [code]#+__swizzled_vec__+# class template must be readable as an
    r-value reference on the RHS of an expression. In this case the swizzle
    operation is performed on the RHS of the expression and then the result
    is applied to the LHS of the expression.
  * The [code]#+__swizzled_vec__+# class template must be assignable as
    an l-value reference on the LHS of an expression. In this case the RHS
    of the expression is applied to the original SYCL [code]#vec# which
    the [code]#+__swizzled_vec__+# represents via the swizzle operation.
    Note that a [code]#+__swizzled_vec__+# that is used in an l-value
    expression may not contain any repeated element indexes.
+
For example: [code]#f4.xxxx() = fx.wzyx()# would not be valid.
  * The [code]#+__swizzled_vec__+# class template must be convertible to
    an instance of SYCL [code]#vec# with the type [code]#DataT#
    and number of elements specified by the swizzle member function, if
    [code]#NumElements > 1#, and must be convertible to an instance of
    type [code]#DataT#, if [code]#NumElements == 1#.
  * The [code]#+__swizzled_vec__+# class template must be non-copyable,
    non-moveable, non-user constructible and may not be bound to a l-value
    or escape the expression it was constructed in. For example
    [code]#auto x = f4.x()# would not be valid.
  * The [code]#+__swizzled_vec__+# class template should return
    [code]#+__swizzled_vec__ &+# for each operator inherited from the
    [code]#vec# class template interface which would return
    [code]#vec<DataT, NumElements> &#.


==== Rounding modes

function template are described in <<table.vec.roundingmodes>>.

[[memory-layout-and-alignment]]
==== Memory layout and alignment

The elements of an instance of the SYCL [code]#vec# class template are
stored in memory sequentially and contiguously and are aligned to the size
of the element type in bytes multiplied by the number of elements:

[[vec-memory-alignment]]
[latexmath]
++++
\texttt{sizeof}(\texttt{DataT}) \cdot \texttt{NumElements}
++++

The exception to this is when the number of element is three in which case
the SYCL [code]#vec# is aligned to the size of the element type in
bytes multiplied by four:

[[vec3-memory-alignment]]
[latexmath]
++++
\texttt{sizeof}(\texttt{DataT}) \cdot 4
++++

This is true for both host and device code in order to allow for instances
of the [code]#vec# class template to be passed to SYCL kernel
functions.


==== Performance note

The usage of the subscript [code]#operator[]# may not be efficient on some devices.

// %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% end vec_class %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

// \input{marray_class}

// %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% begin marray_class %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

[[sec:marray.type]]
=== Math array types

SYCL provides an [code]#marray<typename DataT, std::size_t NumElements># class
template to represent a contiguous fixed-size container.  This type allows
sharing of containers between the host and its SYCL devices.

The [code]#marray# class is templated on its element type and number of
elements. The number of elements parameter, [code]#NumElements#, is a positive
value of the [code]#std::size_t# type. The element type parameter, [code]#DataT#,
must be a _numeric type_ as it is defined by {cpp} standard.

An instance of the [code]#marray# class template can also be
implicitly converted to an instance of the data type when the number of
elements is [code]#1# in order to allow single element arrays and
scalars to be convertible with each other.

Logical and comparison operators for [code]#marray# class template
return [code]#marray<bool, NumElements>#.


==== Math array interface

The constructors, member functions and non-member functions of the SYCL
[code]#marray# class template are listed in
<<table.constructors.marray>>, <<table.members.marray>> and
<<table.functions.marray>> respectively.

==== Aliases

The SYCL programming API provides all permutations of the type alias:

[code]#+using m<type><elems> = marray<<storage-type>, <elems>>+#

where [code]#<elems># is [code]#2#, [code]#3#, [code]#4#,
[code]#8# and [code]#16#, and pairings of [code]#<type># and
[code]#<storage-type># for integral types are [code]#char# and
[code]#int8_t#, [code]#uchar# and [code]#uint8_t#,
[code]#short# and [code]#int16_t#, [code]#ushort# and
[code]#uint16_t#, [code]#int# and [code]#int32_t#,
[code]#uint# and [code]#uint32_t#, [code]#long# and
[code]#int64_t#, [code]#ulong# and [code]#uint64_t#, for
floating point types are both [code]#half#, [code]#float# and
[code]#double#, and for boolean type [code]#bool#.

For example [code]#muint4# is the alias to [code]#marray<uint32_t, 4>#
and [code]#mfloat16# is the alias to [code]#marray<float, 16>#.

== Synchronization and atomics

The available features are:

  * Accessor classes: Accessor classes specify acquisition and release of
    buffer and image data structures to provide points at which underlying
    queue synchronization primitives must be generated.
  * Atomic operations: SYCL devices support a restricted subset of {cpp}
    atomics and SYCL uses the library syntax from the next {cpp} specification
    to make this available.
  * Fences: Fence primitives are made available to order loads and stores.
    They are exposed through the [code]#atomic_fence# function. Fences
    can have acquire semantics, release semantics or both.
  * Barriers: Barrier primitives are made available to synchronize sets of
    work-items within individual <<group,groups>>. They are exposed through the
    [code]#group_barrier# function.
  * Hierarchical parallel dispatch: In the hierarchical parallelism model of
    describing computations, synchronization within the work-group is made
    explicit through multiple instances of the
    [code]#parallel_for_work_item# function call, rather than through
    the use of explicit <<work-group-barrier>> operations.
  * Device event: they are used inside SYCL kernel functions to wait for
    asynchronous operations within a SYCL kernel function to complete.


[[sec:barriers-fences]]
=== Barriers and fences

A <<group-barrier>> or <<mem-fence>> provides memory ordering semantics
over both the local address space and global address space.  A
<<mem-fence>> provides control over the re-ordering of memory load and
store operations, subject to the associated memory [code]#order# and memory
[code]#scope#, when paired with synchronization through an atomic object.

[source,,linenums]
----
include::{header_dir}/synchronization.h[lines=4..-1]
----

The effects of a call to [code]#atomic_fence# depend on the value of
the [code]#order# parameter:

  * [code]#memory_order::relaxed:# No effect
  * [code]#memory_order::acquire:# Acquire fence
  * [code]#memory_order::release:# Release fence
  * [code]#memory_order::acq_rel:# Both an acquire fence and a release
    fence
  * [code]#memory_order::seq_cst:# A sequentially consistent acquire
    and release fence

A <<group-barrier>> acts as both an acquire fence and a release fence: all
work-items in the group execute a release fence prior to synchronizing at
the barrier, and all work-items in the group execute an acquire fence
afterwards.  A <<group-barrier>> provides implicit atomic synchronization
as if through an internal atomic object, such that the acquire and release fences
associated with the barrier synchronize with each other, without an explicit
atomic operation being required on an atomic object to synchronize the fences.


[[device-event-class]]
=== [code]#device_event# class

The SYCL [code]#device_event# class encapsulates a single SYCL device event
which is available only within SYCL kernel functions and can be used to wait for
asynchronous operations within a SYCL kernel function to complete.

All member functions of the [code]#device_event# class must not throw a
SYCL exception.

A synopsis of the SYCL [code]#device_event# class is provided below. The
constructors and member functions of the SYCL [code]#device_event# class
are listed in <<table.constructors.device-event>> and
<<table.members.device-event>> respectively.

[[sec:atomic-references]]
=== Atomic references

The SYCL specification provides atomic operations based on the library
syntax from the next {cpp} specification. The set of supported orderings is
specific to a device, but every device is guaranteed to support at least
[code]#memory_order::relaxed#. Since different devices have different
capabilities, there is no default ordering in SYCL and the default order
used by each instance of [code]#sycl::atomic_ref# is set by a template
argument. If the default order is set to [code]#memory_order::relaxed#,
all memory order arguments default to [code]#memory_order::relaxed#. If
the default order is set to [code]#memory_order::acq_rel#, memory order
arguments default to [code]#memory_order::acquire# for load operations,
[code]#memory_order::release# for store operations and
[code]#memory_order::acq_rel# for read-modify-write operations. If the
default order is set to [code]#memory_order::seq_cst#, all memory order
arguments default to [code]#memory_order::seq_cst#.

The SYCL atomic library may map directly to the underlying {cpp} library in
<<sycl-application>> code, and must interact safely with the host {cpp}
atomic library when used in host code. The SYCL library must be used in
device code to ensure that only the limited subset of functionality is
available. SYCL device compilers should give a compilation error on use of
the [code]#std::atomic# and [code]#std::atomic_ref# classes and
functions in device code.

The template parameter [code]#Space# is permitted to be
[code]#access::address_space::generic_space#,
[code]#access::address_space::global_space# or [code]#access::address_space::local_space#.

The data type [code]#T# is permitted to be [code]#int#, [code]#unsigned int#, [code]#long#,
[code]#unsigned long#,
[code]#long long#,
[code]#unsigned long long#, [code]#float# or
[code]#double#.  For floating-point types, the member functions of the
[code]#atomic_ref# class may be emulated, and may use a different
floating-point environment to those defined by
[code]#info::device::single_fp_config# and
[code]#info::device::double_fp_config# (i.e. floating-point atomics may
use different rounding modes and may have different exception behavior).

The atomic types are defined as follows.

[source,,linenums]
----
include::{header_dir}/atomicref.h[lines=4..-1]
----

The constructors and member functions for instances of the SYCL
[code]#atomic_ref# class using any compatible type are listed in
<<table.atomic-refs.constructors>>
and <<table.atomic-refs.members.common>> respectively. Additional member
functions for integral, floating-point and pointer types are listed in
<<table.atomic-refs.members.integral>>,
<<table.atomic-refs.members.floating>>
and <<table.atomic-refs.members.pointer>> respectively.

The static member [code]#required_alignment# describes the minimum
required alignment in bytes of an object that can be referenced by an
[code]#atomic_ref<T>#, which must be at least [code]#alignof(T)#.

The static member [code]#is_always_lock_free# is true if all atomic
operations for type [code]#T# are always lock-free. A SYCL
implementation is not guaranteed to support atomic operations that are not
lock-free.

The static members [code]#default_read_order#, [code]#default_write_order# and
[code]#default_read_modify_write_order# reflect the default memory order values for
each type of atomic operation, consistent with the [code]#DefaultOrder# template.

The atomic operations and member functions behave as described in the {cpp}
specification, barring the restrictions discussed above. Note that care
must be taken when using atomics to implement synchronization routines due
to the lack of forward progress guarantees between work-items in SYCL.  No
work-item may be dependent on another work-item to make progress if the code
is to be portable.

[[subsec:stream]]
== Stream class

The SYCL [code]#stream# class is a buffered output stream that allows
outputting the values of built-in, vector and SYCL types to the console. The
implementation of how values are streamed to the console is left as an
implementation detail.

The way in which values are output by an instance of the SYCL
[code]#stream# class can also be altered using a range of manipulators.

There are two limits that are relevant for the [code]#stream# class.  The
[code]#totalBufferSize# limit specifies the maximum size of the overall
character stream that can be output during a kernel invocation, and the
[code]#workItemBufferSize# limit specifies the maximum size of the
character stream that can be output within a work item before a flush must be
performed.  Both of these limits are specified in bytes.  The
[code]#totalBufferSize# limit must be sufficient to contain the characters
output by all stream statements during execution of a kernel invocation (the
aggregate of outputs from all work items), and the
[code]#workItemBufferSize# limit must be sufficient to contain the
characters output within a work item between stream flush operations.

If the [code]#totalBufferSize# or [code]#workItemBufferSize#
limits are exceeded, it is implementation-defined whether the streamed
characters exceeding the limit are output, or silently ignored/discarded,
and if output it is implementation-defined whether those extra characters
exceeding the [code]#workItemBufferSize# limit count toward the
[code]#totalBufferSize# limit. Regardless of this implementation
defined behavior of output exceeding the limits, no undefined or erroneous
behavior is permitted of an implementation when the limits are exceeded.
Unused characters within [code]#workItemBufferSize# (any portion of the
[code]#workItemBufferSize# capacity that has not been used at the time
of a stream flush) do not count toward the [code]#totalBufferSize#
limit, in that only characters flushed count toward the
[code]#totalBufferSize# limit.

The SYCL [code]#stream# class provides the common reference semantics
(see <<sec:reference-semantics>>).

=== Synchronization

An instance of the SYCL [code]#stream# class is required to synchronize with the host, and must output
everything that is streamed to it via the [code]#operator<<()# operator before a flush operation (that
doesn't exceed the [code]#workItemBufferSize# or [code]#totalBufferSize# limits) within a SYCL
kernel function by the time that the event associated with a command group submission enters the completed
state. The point at which this synchronization occurs and the member function by which this synchronization is
performed are implementation-defined. For example it is valid for an implementation to use
[code]#printf()#.

The SYCL [code]#stream# class is required to output the content of each stream, between flushes (up to
[code]#workItemBufferSize)#, without mixing with content from the same stream in other work items.
There are no other output order guarantees between work items or between streams.  The stream flush
operation therefore delimits the unit of output that is guaranteed to be displayed without mixing with
other work items, with respect to a single stream.


=== Implicit flush

There is guaranteed to be an implicit flush of each stream used by a
kernel, at the end of kernel execution, from the perspective of each
work item.  There is also an implicit flush when the endl stream
manipulator is executed.  No other implicit flushes are permitted in
an implementation.


=== Performance note

The usage of the [code]#stream# class is designed for debugging purposes and is therefore not recommended for performance critical applications.

[[sycl:builtins]]
== SYCL built-in functions for SYCL host and device

// Intentional OpenCL reference
SYCL kernels may execute on any SYCL device, which requires the functions
used in the kernels to be compiled and linked for both device and host. In
the SYCL programming model, the built-ins are available for the entire SYCL
application within the [code]#sycl# namespace, although their semantics
may be different. This section follows the OpenCL 1.2 specification document
<<opencl12, ch. 6.12>> - except that for SYCL, all functions are located
within the [code]#sycl# namespace - and describes the behavior of these
functions for SYCL host and device. The expected precision and any other
semantic requirements are defined in the backend specification.

The SYCL built-in functions are available throughout the SYCL application,
and depending on where they execute, they are either implemented using their
host implementation or the device implementation. The SYCL system guarantees
that all of the built-in functions fulfill the same requirements for both
host and device.


=== Description of the built-in types available for SYCL host and device

All of the OpenCL built-in types are available in the namespace
[code]#sycl#. For the purposes of this document we use
generic type names for describing sets of valid SYCL types. The
generic type names themselves are not valid SYCL types, but they
represent a set of valid types, as defined in
<<table.gentypes>>. Each generic type within a section is
comprised of a combination of scalar, SYCL [code]#vec# and/or [code]#marray# class
specializations. The letters [code]#{n}# and [code]#{N}# define valid sizes for
class specializations, where [code]#{n}# means 2,3,4,8,16 and [code]#{N}# means
any positive value of size_t type. Note that any reference to the base type
refers to the type of a scalar or the element type of a SYCL [code]#vec# or
[code]#marray# specialization.

=== Function objects

SYCL provides a number of function objects in the [code]#sycl# namespace
on host and device.  All function objects obey {cpp} conversion and promotion
rules.  Each function object is additionally specialized for [code]#void#
as a _transparent_ function object that deduces its parameter types
and return type.

[[sec:group-functions]]
=== Group functions

SYCL provides a number of functions that expose functionality tied to groups of
work-items (such as <<group-barrier,group barriers>> and collective operations).
These group functions act as synchronization points and must be encountered in
converged <<control flow>> by all work-items in the group.  If one work-item in
a group calls a group function, then all work-items in that group must call
exactly the same function under the same set of conditions --- calling the same
function under different conditions (e.g. in different iterations of a loop, or
different branches of a conditional statement) results in undefined behavior.
Additionally, restrictions may be placed on the arguments passed to each
function in order to ensure that all work-items in the group agree on the
operation that is being performed.  Any such restrictions on the arguments
passed to a function are defined within the descriptions of those functions.
Violating these restrictions results in undefined behavior.

All group functions are supported for the fundamental scalar types supported by
SYCL (see <<table.types.fundamental>>) and instances of the SYCL
[code]#vec# and [code]#marray# classes.

Using a group function inside of a kernel may introduce additional
limits on the resources available to user code inside the same kernel.  The
behavior of these limits is implementation-defined, but must be reflected by
calls to kernel querying functions (such as
[code]#kernel_bundle::get_kernel_info)# as described in <<sec:bundles.query>>.

It is undefined behavior for any group function to be invoked within a
[code]#parallel_for_work_group# or [code]#parallel_for_work_item#
context.

==== Group type trait

[source,,linenums]
----
include::{header_dir}/algorithms/is_group.h[lines=4..-1]
----

The [code]#is_group# type trait is used to determine which types of groups are
supported by group functions, and to control when group functions participate
in overload resolution.

[code]#is_group<T># is [code]#std::true_type# if [code]#T# is the type of a
standard SYCL group ([code]#group# or [code]#sub_group#) and
[code]#std::false_type# otherwise.  A SYCL implementation may introduce
additional specializations of [code]#is_group<T># for implementation-defined
group types, if the interface of those types supports all member functions and
static members common to the [code]#group# and [code]#sub_group# classes.

==== [code]#group_broadcast#

The [code]#group_broadcast# function communicates a value held by one
work-item to all other work-items in the group.

--
_Effects:_ Synchronizes all work-items in the group. The current work-item will
wait at the barrier until all work-items in the group have reached the barrier.
In addition, the barrier performs <<mem-fence>> operations ensuring that
memory accesses issued before the barrier are not re-ordered with those issued
after the barrier: all work-items in the group execute a release fence prior to
synchronizing at the barrier, all work-items in the group execute an
acquire fence afterwards, and there is an implicit synchronization of these
fences as if provided by an explicit atomic operation on an atomic object.

By default, the scope of these fences is set to the narrowest
scope including all work-items in the group (as reported by
[code]#Group::fence_scope#).  This scope may be optionally overridden
with a broader scope, specified by the [code]#fence_scope# argument.
--

[[sec:algorithms]]
=== Group algorithms library

SYCL provides an algorithms library based on the functions described
in Section 28 of the {cpp17} specification.  The first argument to each function
is a <<group>>, and data ranges can be described using pointers, iterators or
instances of the [code]#multi_ptr# class.  The functions defined in this
section are free functions available in the [code]#sycl# namespace.

Any restrictions from the standard algorithms library apply.  Some of the
functions in the SYCL algorithms library introduce additional restrictions
in order to maximize portability across different devices and to minimize
the chances of encountering unexpected behavior.

All algorithms are supported for the fundamental scalar types supported by SYCL
(see <<table.types.fundamental>>) and instances of the SYCL
[code]#vec# and [code]#marray# classes.

The <<group>> argument to a SYCL algorithm denotes that it should be performed
collaboratively by the work-items in the specified group.  All algorithms
act as group functions (as defined in <<sec:group-functions>>), inheriting all
restrictions of group functions.  Unless the description of a function says
otherwise, how the elements of a range are processed by the work-items in a
group is undefined.

SYCL provides separate functions for algorithms which use the work-items in a
group to execute an operation over a range of iterators and algorithms which
are applied to data held directly by the work-items in a group.  An example
of the usage of these functions is given below:

The [code]#any_of#, [code]#all_of# and [code]#none_of# functions from standard

values in a range, respectively.

SYCL provides two sets of similar algorithms:

. [code]#joint_any_of#, [code]#joint_all_of# and [code]#joint_none_of# use the
work-items in a group to execute the corresponding algorithm in parallel.

. [code]#any_of_group#, [code]#all_of_group# and [code]#none_of_group# test

SYCL provides similar algorithms compatible with the [code]#sub_group# class:

. [code]#shift_group_left# and [code]#shift_group_right# move values held by

==== [code]#permute#

SYCL provides an algorithm to permute the values held by work-items in a
sub-group:

==== [code]#reduce#

The [code]#reduce# function from standard {cpp} combines the values in a range in
an unspecified order using a binary operator.

SYCL provides two similar algorithms that compute the same generalized sum as

. [code]#joint_reduce# uses the work-items in a group to execute a
[code]#reduce# operation in parallel.

. [code]#reduce_over_group# combines values held directly by the work-items in
a group.

The result of a call to these functions is non-deterministic if the binary
operator is not commutative and associative. Only the binary operators defined
in <<sec:function-objects>> are supported by the [code]#reduce# functions in
SYCL 2020, but the standard {cpp} syntax is used for forward compatibility with
future SYCL versions.

==== [code]#exclusive_scan# and [code]#inclusive_scan#

The [code]#exclusive_scan# and [code]#inclusive_scan# functions in standard
{cpp} compute a prefix sum using a binary operator.  For a scan of elements
_[x~0~, {ldots}, x~n~]_, the _i_ th result in an exclusive scan is the
generalized noncommutative sum of all elements preceding _x~i~_ (excluding
_x~i~_ itself), whereas the _i_ th result in an inclusive scan is the
generalized noncommutative sum of all elements preceding _x~i~_ (including
_x~i~_ itself).

SYCL provides two similar sets of algorithms that compute the same prefix sums
using the generalized noncommutative sum as defined by standard {cpp}:

. [code]#joint_exclusive_scan# and [code]#joint_inclusive_scan# use the
work-items in a group to execute the corresponding algorithm in parallel, and
intermediate partial prefix sums are written to memory as in standard {cpp}.

. [code]#exclusive_scan_over_group# and [code]#inclusive_scan_over_group#
perform a scan over values held directly by the work-items in a group, and the
result returned to each work-item represents a partial prefix sum.

The result of a call to a scan is non-deterministic if the binary operator is not
associative.  Only the binary operators defined in <<sec:function-objects>> are
supported by the scan functions in SYCL 2020, but the standard {cpp} syntax is
used for forward compatibility with future SYCL versions.

=== Math functions

In SYCL the OpenCL math functions are available in the namespace
[code]#sycl# on host and device with the same precision
guarantees as defined in the OpenCL 1.2 specification document
<<opencl12, ch. 7>> for host and device. For a SYCL platform the
numerical requirements for host need to match the numerical
requirements of the OpenCL math built-in functions. The built-in
functions can take as input float or optionally double and
their [code]#vec# and [code]#marray# counterparts,
for all supported dimensions including dimension 1.

The built-in functions available for SYCL host and device, with the same
precision requirements for both host and device, are described in
<<table.math.functions>>.


[[table.math.functions]]
.Math functions which work on SYCL host and device. They correspond to <<opencl12, Table 6.8 of the OpenCL 1.2 specification>>.
