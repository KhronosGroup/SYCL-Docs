[appendix]
[[chapter:host-backend]]
= Host backend specification

This chapter describes how SYCL is mapped on the <<host-backend>>.
The <<host-backend>> exposes the host where the SYCL application is executing as
a platform to dispatch SYCL kernels.
The <<host-backend>> exposes at least one <<host-device>>.


== Mapping of the SYCL programming model on the host

// From Glossary, reworded to match backend

The SYCL host device implements all functionality required to execute the SYCL
kernels directly on the host, without relying on a third party API.
It has full SYCL capabilities and reports them through the SYCL information
retrieval interface.
At least one SYCL host device must be exposed in the SYCL host backend in all
SYCL implementations, and it must always be available.
Any {cpp} application debugger, if available on the system, can be used for
debugging SYCL kernels executing on a SYCL host device.

// From Architecture, Section 3.3
When a SYCL implementation executes kernels on the host device, it is free to
use whatever parallel execution facilities available on the host, as long as it
executes within the semantics of the kernel execution model defined by the SYCL
kernel execution model.

Kernel math library functions on the host must conform to OpenCL math precision
requirements.
The SYCL host device needs to be queried for the capabilities it provides.
This ensures consistency when executing any SYCL general application.

The <<host-device>> must report as supporting images and therefore support the
minimum image formats.

The range of image formats supported by the host device is
implementation-defined, but must match the minimum requirements of the OpenCL
specification.

SYCL implementors can provide extensions on the host-device to match any other
backend-specific extension.
This allows developers to rely on the host device to execute their programs when
said backend is not available.


=== SYCL memory model on the host

All SYCL device memories are available on devices from the host backend.

== Interoperability with the host application

The host backend must ensure all functionality of the SYCL generic programming
model is always available to developers.
However, since there is no heterogeneous API behind the host backend (it
directly targets the host platform), there are no native types for SYCL objects
to map to in the SYCL application.

Inside SYCL kernels, the host backend must ensure interoperability with existing
host code, so that existing host libraries can be used inside SYCL kernels
executing on the host.
In particular, when retrieving a raw pointer from a multi pointer object, the
pointer returned must be usable by any library accessible by the SYCL
application.
