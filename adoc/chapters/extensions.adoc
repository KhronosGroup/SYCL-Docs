= SYCL Extensions

This chapter describes the mechanism by which the <<core-spec>> can be extended.
Some parts of this chapter are requirements that all implementations must follow
if they extend the <<core-spec>>, while other parts of the chapter are merely
guidelines.
Unless a requirement is specifically stated as normative, all content in this
chapter is a non-normative guideline.

An extension can be either of two flavors: an extension ratified by the Khronos
SYCL group or a vendor supplied extension.
In both cases, an extension is an optional feature set which an implementation
need not implement in order to be conformant with the <<core-spec>>.

Vendors may choose to define extensions in order to expose custom features or to
gather feedback on an API that is not yet ready for inclusion in the
<<core-spec>>.
Once a vendor extension has stabilized, the vendor is encouraged to promote it
to a future version of the <<core-spec>> or to a ratified Khronos extension.
Thus, vendor extensions can be viewed as a pipeline of features for
consideration in future SYCL versions.

The Khronos SYCL group may define extensions for features that are not yet ready
for the <<core-spec>> but are implemented by more than one vendor.
These extensions also may be considered for inclusion in a future version of the
<<core-spec>>.

This chapter does not describe any particular extension to SYCL.
Rather, it describes the _mechanism_ for defining an extension.
Each extension is defined by its own separate document.
If an extension is ratified by the Khronos SYCL group, that group will release a
document describing the extension.
If a vendor defines an extension, the vendor is responsible for releasing its
documentation.


== Definition of an extension

An extension can take many possible forms.
Some examples include:

  * adding new types or free functions to the SYCL runtime;
  * modifying existing SYCL classes, structs, or enumeration types by adding new
    members, member functions, or enumerated values;
  * adding new overloads for existing free functions or member functions;
  * defining new specializations for existing SYCL templates;
  * adding new {cpp} attributes;
  * adding new predefined macros;
  * adding new keywords to the language;
  * adding a new backend.

An extension may also broaden the definition of existing functions defined in
the <<core-spec>> by defining semantics for cases that are left unspecified by
the <<core-spec>>.


== Requirements for an extension

This section is normative.
All vendors which provide an extension must abide by the requirements described
here.

An extension may not change the definition of existing functions defined by the
<<core-spec>> in a way that changes their specified behavior.
Also, an extension may not remove any feature defined by the <<core-spec>>.

The vendor must choose at least one [code]#<vendorstring># which uniquely
identifies the vendor's SYCL implementation.
The Khronos SYCL group does not provide any registry of the strings, so each
vendor is responsible for choosing its own.
One way to choose a unique string is to use the vendor's company name or a
marketing name that is associated with the vendor's implementation.
Ultimately, it is each vendor's responsibility to choose a string that is
unique.
The strings "khr" and "KHR" are reserved for the Khronos SYCL group for its own
extensions, so vendors may not use these as a [code]#<vendorstring>#.

The implementation must predefine at least one macro of the form
[code]#SYCL_IMPLEMENTATION_<vendorstring># which allows applications to test
whether they are being compiled with that vendor's implementation.
For example, the Acme vendor could predefine a macro whose name is
[code]#SYCL_IMPLEMENTATION_ACME#.


== Guidelines for portable extensions

Vendors who want to ensure that their extension does not collide with other
vendors' extensions or with future versions of the <<core-spec>> should follow
the additional rules specified in this section.
However, this is not a requirement for conformance.

=== Extension namespace

If an extension adds new types or free functions, it should avoid adding these
directly in the [code]#sycl::# namespace since future versions of the
<<core-spec>> may also add new identifiers in this namespace.
The namespace [code]#sycl::ext::<vendorstring># is reserved for use by
extensions.
For example, the Acme vendor could define extended types and free functions in
the namespace [code]#sycl::ext::acme#, and this would guarantee that they will
not collide with definitions in other vendors' extensions or with future
versions of the <<core-spec>>.

=== Names for extensions to existing classes or enumerations

An extension may add new members or member functions to existing SYCL classes or
new values to existing SYCL enumeration types.
To ensure these extensions do not collide, vendors are encouraged to name them
with the prefix [code]#ext_<vendorstring>_#.
For example, the Acme vendor could add a new member function to the
[code]#sycl::device# class named [code]#device::ext_acme_fancy()# or a new value
to the [code]#sycl::aspect# enumeration named [code]#aspect::ext_acme_fancier#.

In some cases, an extension does not have the freedom to choose a specific
function name.
For example, this could happen if the extension adds a new constructor overload
for an existing SYCL class.
In cases like this, the extension should ensure that one of the function
parameters has a type that is defined in the extension's namespace.
For example, the Acme vendor could add a new constructor for
[code]#sycl::context# with the signature [code]#context(ext::acme::frobber&)#.

A similar situation can occur if an existing SYCL template is specialized with
an extended enumerated value.
Obviously, the extension cannot rename the template in this case.
Instead, it is sufficient that the template is specialized with an extended
enumerated value, and this guarantees that the extended specialization will not
collide.

[NOTE]
====
Vendors are encouraged to use the [code]#ext_<vendorstring>_# prefix form when
possible for additions to existing SYCL classes because this form makes the
extension's vendor name apparent.
People reading application code will immediately know that a member function is
an extension, and they will immediately know which vendor's documentation to
consult.
====

=== Feature test macros

Vendors are encouraged to group a related set of extensions together into a
"feature" and to predefine a feature-test macro when the implementation supports
the extensions in that feature.
The feature-test macro should have the following form to ensure it is unique:
[code]#SYCL_EXT_<vendorstring>_<featurename>#.
For example, the Acme vendor might define a feature-test macro named
[code]#SYCL_EXT_ACME_FANCYFEATURE#.
This allows applications to protect code using the extension with
[code]##ifdef#, so that the code is skipped when compiled with an implementation
that doesn't support the feature.

Since the interface to an extension might change from one release to another,
vendors are also encouraged to predefine the macro's value to the version of the
extension.
Vendors should use a numerical value that monotonically increases for each
revision of the extension API.

Of course, an extension may also predefine other macros.
In order to ensure that these macro names do not collide with other extensions
or future versions of the <<core-spec>>, the name should start with the prefix
[code]#SYCL_EXT_<vendorstring># or [code]#SYCL_IMPLEMENTATION_<vendorstring>#.

=== Attribute namespace

An extension may define new {cpp} attributes.
The attribute namespace [code]#sycl::# is reserved for the <<core-spec>>, so
vendors should choose a different namespace for any attributes they add.

=== Include file paths

An extension may define new [code]##include# files under the [code]#"sycl"#
path.
The path prefix [code]#"sycl/ext/<vendorstring>"# is reserved for this purpose.
For example, the Acme vendor could add a header file
[code]#"sycl/ext/acme/fancy.h"# and be guaranteed that it would not conflict
with other extensions or with future versions of the <<core-spec>>.

=== Optional kernel features

An extension may also add new optional kernel features -- features which are
supported on some devices but not on others.
Vendors are encouraged to follow the same mechanism outlined in
<<sec:optional-kernel-features>>.
Therefore, an extended optional kernel feature should have a matching extension
to the [code]#sycl::aspect# enumerated type.

=== Adding a backend

An extension may also add a new backend.
If it does, the naming of the backend APIs follows the normal guidelines for
extensions and also follows the naming pattern for backends that are defined in
the <<core-spec>>.
To illustrate:

* The extension should add a new value to the [code]#sycl::backend# enumeration
  type using a naming scheme like [code]#ext_<vendorstring>_<backendname>#.
  For example, if the Acme vendor adds a backend named "foo", it would add an
  enumerated value named [code]#sycl::backend::ext_acme_foo#.

* The extension should define the backend's interop API in a namespace named
  [code]#sycl::ext::<vendorstring>::<backendname>#.
  For our hypothetical Acme example, this would be a namespace named
  [code]#sycl::ext::acme::foo#.

* If the backend interop API is available through a separate header file, that
  header should be named
  [code]#"sycl/ext/<vendorstring>/backend/<backendname>.hpp"#.
  For our hypothetical Acme example this would be
  [code]#"sycl/ext/acme/backend/foo.hpp"#.

* The extension should predefine a macro for the backend when it is "active".
  The name of this macro should be
  [code]#SYCL_EXT_<vendorstring>_BACKEND_<backendname>#.
  For our hypothetical Acme example this would be
  [code]#SYCL_EXT_ACME_BACKEND_FOO#.
