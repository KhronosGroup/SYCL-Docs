  # We use the pull_request_target trigger to always run the workflow in the context of the base branch,
  # since this allows us to access repository secrets even if the PR originates from a fork.
  #
  # Importantly, the workflow must not checkout any code from the PR branch, as this could allow an attacker
  # to gain write access to the repository.
  # See https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-preventing-pwn-requests/ for more information.
